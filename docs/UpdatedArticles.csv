 ## Change to behavior for NULLs and Zero values 
  
-For the platform metrics that can be exported via diagnostic settings, there are a few metrics for which Azure Monitor interprets '0s' as 'Nulls'. This has caused some confusion between real '0s' (emitted by resource) and interpreted '0s' (Nulls).

Soon a change will occur and platform metrics exported via diagnostic settings will no longer export '0s' unless they have truly been emitted by the underlying resource. The change was scheduled for April 1, 2020, but has been delayed due to priority shifts due to COVID-19.

 1.	If you delete a resource group or a specific resource, metric data from the effected resources will no longer be sent to diagnostic setting export destinations. That is, it will no longer appear in Event Hubs, Storage Accounts and Log Analytics Workspaces.

 ### Assumptions
 
-The customer has deployed an ASE with an ILB and has implemented an ExpressRoute connection via the DISA Cloud Access Point (CAP) process.
+The customer has deployed an ASE with an ILB and has implemented an ExpressRoute connection to the DISA Cloud Access Point (CAP).
 
 ### Route table
 
-When creating the ASE via the portal, a route table with a default route of 0.0.0.0/0 and next hop “Internet” is created.  However, the DISA BGP routes will advertise for 0.0.0.0/0 and this route table should be removed from the ASE subnet.

+However, since DISA advertises a default route out the ExpressRoute circuit, the User Defined Route (UDR) should either be deleted, or remove the default route to internet.  
 
-### Network security group (NSG)

 Azure Monitor Logs is designed to scale and support collecting, indexing, and storing massive amounts of data per day from any source in your enterprise or deployed in Azure.  While this may be a primary driver for your organization, cost-efficiency is ultimately the underlying driver. To that end, it's important to understand that the cost of a Log Analytics workspace isn't based only on the volume of data collected, it is also dependent on the plan selected, and how long you chose to store data generated from your connected sources.

For data collected earlier, setting a lower retention for an individual type will not affect your retention costs.  
 
 ## Manage your maximum daily data volume
 
 You can configure a daily cap and limit the daily ingestion for your workspace, but use care as your goal should not be to hit the daily limit.  Otherwise, you lose data for the remainder of the day, which can impact other Azure services and solutions whose functionality may depend on up-to-date data being available in the workspace.  As a result, your ability to observe and receive alerts when the health conditions of resources supporting IT services are impacted.  The daily cap is intended to be used as a way to manage the unexpected increase in data volume from your managed resources and stay within your limit, or when you want to limit unplanned charges for your workspace.  
 
-When the daily limit is reached, the collection of billable data types stops for the rest of the day. A warning banner appears across the top of the page for the selected Log Analytics workspace and an operation event is sent to the *Operation* table under **LogManagement** category. Data collection resumes after the reset time defined under *Daily limit will be set at*. We recommend defining an alert rule based on this operation event, configured to notify when the daily data limit has been reached.

+# Collect and analyze Azure Activity log in Azure Monitor
+The [Azure Activity log](platform-logs-overview.md) is a [platform log](platform-logs-overview.md) that provides insight into subscription-level events that have occurred in Azure. While you can view the Activity log in the Azure portal, you should configure it to send to a Log Analytics workspace to enable additional features of Azure Monitor. This article describes how to perform this configuration and how to send the Activity log to Azure storage and event hubs.
 
-> [!WARNING]
-> You can now collect the Activity log into a Log Analytics workspace using a diagnostic setting similar to how you collect resource logs. See [Collect and analyze Azure activity logs in Log Analytics workspace in Azure Monitor](diagnostic-settings-legacy.md).
+Collecting the Activity Log in a Log Analytics workspace provides the following advantages:
 
-The [Azure Activity Log](platform-logs-overview.md) provides insight into subscription-level events that have occurred in your Azure subscription. This article describes how to collect the Activity Log into a Log Analytics workspace and how to use the Activity Log Analytics [monitoring solution](../insights/solutions.md), which provides log queries and views for analyzing this data. 
+- No data ingestion or data retention charge for Activity log data stored in a Log Analytics workspace.
+- Correlate Activity log data with other monitoring data collected by Azure Monitor.
+- Use log queries to perform complex analysis and gain deep insights on Activity Log entries.
+- Use log alerts with Activity entries allowing for more complex alerting logic.
+- Store Activity log entries for longer than 90 days.
+- Consolidate log entries from multiple Azure subscriptions and tenants into one location for analysis together.
 
-Connecting the Activity Log to a Log Analytics workspace provides the following benefits:
 
-- Consolidate the Activity Log from multiple Azure subscriptions into one location for analysis.
-- Store Activity Log entries for longer than 90 days.
-- Correlate Activity Log data with other monitoring data collected by Azure Monitor.
-- Use [log queries](../log-query/log-query-overview.md) to perform complex analysis and gain deep insights on Activity Log entries.
 
-## Connect to Log Analytics workspace
-A single workspace can be connected to the Activity Log for multiple subscriptions in the same Azure tenant. For collection across multiple tenants, see [Collect Azure Activity Logs into a Log Analytics workspace across subscriptions in different Azure Active Directory tenants](activity-log-collect-tenants.md).
+## Collecting Activity log
+The Activity log is collected automatically for [viewing in the Azure portal](activity-log-view.md). To collect it in a Log Analytics workspace or to send it Azure storage or event hubs, create a [diagnostic setting](diagnostic-settings.md). This is the same method used by resource logs making it consistent for all [platform logs](platform-logs-overview.md).  
+
+To create a diagnostic setting for the Activity log, select **Diagnostic settings** from the **Activity log** menu in Azure Monitor. See [Create diagnostic setting to collect platform logs and metrics in Azure](diagnostic-settings.md) for details on creating the setting. See [Categories in the Activity log](activity-log-view.md#categories-in-the-activity-log) for a description of the categories you can filter. If you have any legacy settings, make sure you disable them before creating a diagnostic setting. Having both enabled may result in duplicate data.
+
+![Diagnostic settings](media/diagnostic-settings-subscription/diagnostic-settings.png)
+
+
+> [!NOTE]
+> Currently, you can only create a subscription level diagnostic setting using the Azure portal and a Resource Manager template. 
+
+
+## Legacy settings 
+While diagnostic settings are the preferred method to send the Activity log to different destinations, legacy methods will continue to work if you don't choose to replace with a diagnostic setting. Diagnostic settings have the following advantages over legacy methods, and it's recommended that you update your configuration:
+
+- Consistent method for collecting all platform logs.
+- Collect Activity log across multiple subscriptions and tenants.
+- Filter collection to only collect logs for particular categories.
+- Collect all Activity log categories. Some categories are not collected using legacy method.
+- Faster latency for log ingestion. The previous method has about 15 minutes latency while diagnostic settings adds only about 1 minute.
 
-> [!IMPORTANT]
-> You may receive an error with the following procedure if the Microsoft.OperationalInsights and Microsoft.OperationsManagement resource providers aren't registered for your subscription. See [Azure resource providers and types](../../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types.md) to register these providers.
 
-Use the following procedure to connect the Activity Log to your Log Analytics workspace:
+
+### Log profiles
+Log profiles are the legacy method for sending the Activity log to Azure storage or event hubs. Use the following procedure to continue working with a log profile or to disable it in preparation for migrating to a diagnostic setting.

+
+### Log Analytics workspace
+The legacy method for collecting the Activity log into a Log Analytics workspace is connecting the log in the workspace configuration. 
 
 1. From the **Log Analytics workspaces** menu in the Azure portal, select the workspace to collect the Activity Log.
 1. In the **Workspace Data Sources** section of the workspace's menu, select **Azure Activity log**.
 1. Click the subscription you want to connect.

+
+To disable the setting, perform the same procedure and click **Disconnect** to remove the subscription from the workspace.
+
+
+## Analyze Activity log in Log Analytics workspace
+When you connect an Activity Log to a Log Analytics workspace, entries will be written to the workspace into a table called *AzureActivity* that you can retrieve with a [log query](../log-query/log-query-overview.md). The structure of this table varies depending on the [category of the log entry](activity-log-view.md#categories-in-the-activity-log). See [Azure Activity Log event schema](activity-log-schema.md) for a description of each category.
+
+
+### Data structure changes
+Diagnostic settings collect the same data as the legacy method used to collect the Activity log with some changes to the structure of the *AzureActivity* table.
+
+The columns in the following table have been deprecated in the updated schema. They still exist in *AzureActivity* but they will have no data. The replacement for these columns are not new, but they contain the same data as the deprecated column. They are in a different format, so you may need to modify log queries that use them.

-# Update to Azure Activity log collection and export
-The [Azure Activity log](platform-logs-overview.md) is a [platform log](platform-logs-overview.md) that provides insight into subscription-level events that have occurred in Azure. The method to send Activity log entries to [an event hub or storage account](activity-log-export.md) or to a [Log Analytics workspace](activity-log-collect.md) has changed to use [diagnostic settings](diagnostic-settings.md). This article describes the difference between the methods and how to clear legacy settings in preparation to change to diagnostic settings.
-
-
-## Differences between methods
-
-### Advantages
-Using diagnostic settings has the following advantages over the current methods:
-
-- Consistent method for collecting all platform logs.
-- Collect Activity log across multiple subscriptions and tenants.
-- Filter collection to only collect logs for particular categories.
-- Collect all Activity log categories. Some categories are not collected using legacy method.
-- Faster latency for log ingestion. The previous method has about 15 minutes latency while diagnostic settings adds only about 1 minute.
-
-### Considerations
-Consider the following details of Activity log collection using diagnostic settings before enabling this feature.
-
-- The retention setting for collecting the Activity log to Azure storage has been removed meaning that data will be stored indefinitely until you remove it.
-- Currently, you can only create a subscription level diagnostic setting using the Azure portal. To use other methods such as PowerShell or CLI, you can create a Resource Manager template.
-
-
-### Differences in data
-Diagnostic settings collect the same data as the previous methods used to collect the Activity log with the following current differences:
-
-The following columns have been removed. The replacement for these columns are in a different format, so you may need to modify log queries that use them. You may still see removed columns in the schema, but they won't be populated with data.
-
-| Removed column | Replacement column |
-|:---|:---|
-| ActivityStatus    | ActivityStatusValue    |
-| ActivitySubstatus | ActivitySubstatusValue |
-| OperationName     | OperationNameValue     |
-| ResourceProvider  | ResourceProviderValue  |
-
-The following column have been added:
-
-- Authorization_d
-- Claims_d
-- Properties_d
-
-> [!IMPORTANT]
-> In some cases, the values in these columns may be in all uppercase. If you have a query that includes these columns, you should use the [=~ operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/kusto/query/datatypes-string-operators) to do a case insensitive comparison.
-
-## Work with legacy settings
-Legacy settings for collecting the Activity log will continue to work if you don't choose to replace with a diagnostic setting. Use the following method to manage the log profile for a subscription.
-
-1. From the **Azure Monitor** menu in the Azure portal, select **Activity log**.
-3. Click **Diagnostic settings**.
-
-   ![Diagnostic settings](media/diagnostic-settings-subscription/diagnostic-settings.png)
-
-4. Click the purple banner for the legacy experience.
-
-    ![Legacy experience](media/diagnostic-settings-subscription/legacy-experience.png)
-
-
-See the following articles for details on using the legacy collection methods.
-
-- [Collect and analyze Azure activity logs in Log Analytics workspace in Azure Monitor](activity-log-collect.md)
-- [Collect Azure Activity logs into Azure Monitor across Azure Active Directory tenants](activity-log-collect-tenants.md)
-- [Export Azure Activity log to storage or Azure Event Hubs](activity-log-export.md)
-
-## Disable existing settings
-You should disable existing collection of the Activity before enabling it using diagnostic settings. Having both enabled may result in duplicate data.
-
-### Disable collection into Log Analytics workspace
-
-1. Open the **Log Analytics workspaces** menu in the Azure portal and select the workspace to collect the Activity Log.
-2. In the **Workspace Data Sources** section of the workspace's menu, select **Azure Activity log**.
-3. Click the subscription you want to disconnect.
-4. Click **Disconnect** and then **Yes** when asked to confirm your choice.
-
-### Disable log profile
-
-1. Use the procedure described in [Work with legacy settings](#work-with-legacy-settings) to open legacy settings.
-2. Disable any current collection to storage or event hubs.
-
-
-
-## Activity Log monitoring solution
-The Azure Log Analytics monitoring solution includes multiple log queries and views for analyzing the Activity Log records in your Log Analytics workspace. This solution uses log data collected in a Log Analytics workspace and will continue to work without any changes if you collect the Activity log using diagnostic settings. See [Activity Logs Analytics monitoring solution](activity-log-collect.md#activity-logs-analytics-monitoring-solution) for details on this solution.

+title: Configure GPU monitoring with Azure Monitor for containers | Microsoft Docs
+description: This article describes how you can configure monitoring Kubernetes clusters with NVIDIA and AMD GPU enabled nodes with Azure Monitor for containers.
+ms.topic: conceptual
+ms.date: 03/27/2020
+---
+
+# Configure GPU monitoring with Azure Monitor for containers
+
+Starting with agent version *ciprod03022019*, Azure monitor for containers integrated agent now supports monitoring GPU (graphical processing units) usage on GPU-aware Kubernetes cluster nodes, and monitor pods/containers requesting and using GPU resources.
+
+## Supported GPU vendors
+
+Azure Monitor for Containers supports monitoring GPU clusters from following GPU vendors:
+
+- [NVIDIA](https://developer.nvidia.com/kubernetes-gpu)
+
+- [AMD](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/k8s-device-plugin)
+
+Azure Monitor for containers automatically starts monitoring GPU usage on nodes, and GPU requesting pods and workloads by collecting the following metrics at 60sec intervals and storing them in the **InsightMetrics** table:
+
+|Metric name |Metric dimension (tags) |Description |
+|------------|------------------------|------------|
+|containerGpuDutyCycle |container.azm.ms/clusterId, container.azm.ms/clusterName, containerName, gpuId, gpuModel, gpuVendor|Percentage of time over the past sample period (60 seconds) during which GPU was busy/actively processing for a container. Duty cycle is a number between 1 and 100. |
+|containerGpuLimits |container.azm.ms/clusterId, container.azm.ms/clusterName, containerName |Each container can specify limits as one or more GPUs. It is not possible to request or limit a fraction of a GPU. |
+|containerGpuRequests |container.azm.ms/clusterId, container.azm.ms/clusterName, containerName |Each container can request one or more GPUs. It is not possible to request or limit a fraction of a GPU.|
+|containerGpumemoryTotalBytes |container.azm.ms/clusterId, container.azm.ms/clusterName, containerName, gpuId, gpuModel, gpuVendor |Amount of GPU Memory in bytes available to use for a specific container. |
+|containerGpumemoryUsedBytes |container.azm.ms/clusterId, container.azm.ms/clusterName, containerName, gpuId, gpuModel, gpuVendor |Amount of GPU Memory in bytes used by a specific container. |
+|nodeGpuAllocatable |container.azm.ms/clusterId, container.azm.ms/clusterName, gpuVendor |Number of GPUs in a node that can be used by Kubernetes. |
+|nodeGpuCapacity |container.azm.ms/clusterId, container.azm.ms/clusterName, gpuVendor |Total Number of GPUs in a node. |

+Azure Monitor for containers includes pre-configured charts for the metrics listed earlier in the table as a GPU workbook for every cluster. You can find the GPU workbook **Node GPU** directly from an AKS cluster by selecting **Workbooks** from the left-hand pane, and from the **View Workbooks** drop-down list in the Insight.
+
+## Next steps
+
+- See [Use GPUs for compute-intensive workloads on Azure Kubernetes Service](../../aks/gpu-cluster.md) (AKS) to learn how to deploy an AKS cluster that includes GPU-enabled nodes.
+
+- Learn more about [GPU Optimized VM SKUs in Microsoft Azure](../../virtual-machines/sizes-gpu.md).

 ## Search logs to analyze data
 
 Azure Monitor Logs can help you look for trends, diagnose bottlenecks, forecast, or correlate data that can help you determine whether the current cluster configuration is performing optimally. Pre-defined log searches are provided for you to immediately start using or to customize to return the information the way you want.
 
 You can perform interactive analysis of data in the workspace by selecting the **View Kubernetes event logs** or **View container logs** option in the preview pane from the **View in analytics** drop-down list. The **Log Search** page appears to the right of the Azure portal page that you were on.

 The container logs output that's forwarded to your workspace are STDOUT and STDERR. Because Azure Monitor is monitoring Azure-managed Kubernetes (AKS), Kube-system is not collected today because of the large volume of generated data.

 ### Create *Cluster* resource
 
 This resource is used as an intermediate identity connection between your Key Vault and your workspaces. After you receive confirmation that your subscriptions were whitelisted, create a Log Analytics *Cluster* resource at the region where your workspaces are located. Application Insights and Log Analytics require separate *Cluster* resources types. The type of the *Cluster* resource is defined at creation time by setting the ""clusterType"" property to either ""LogAnalytics"", or ""ApplicationInsights"". The Cluster resource type can’t be altered after.
 
 For Application Insights CMK configuration, follow the Appendix content.

This property doesn’t affect billing currently -- once pricing model for dedicated cluster is introduced, billing will apply to any existing CMK deployments.

You can see a summary of data collection at [Add Log Analytics solutions from the Solutions Gallery](../../azure-monitor/insights/solutions.md). Additionally, more detailed collection information is available for most solutions. A solution is a bundle of predefined views, log search queries, data collection rules, and processing logic. Only administrators can use Log Analytics to import a solution. After the solution is imported, it is moved to the Operations Manager management servers (if used), and then to any agents that you have chosen. Afterward, the agents collect the data.

 The Windows or management server agent cached data is protected by the operating system's credential store. If the service cannot process the data after two hours, the agents will queue the data. If the queue becomes full, the agent starts dropping data types, starting with performance data. The agent queue limit is a registry key so you can modify it, if necessary. Collected data is compressed and sent to the service, bypassing the Operations Manager management group databases, so it does not add any load to them. After the collected data is sent, it is removed from the cache.

 ## 3. The Log Analytics service receives and processes data
 The Log Analytics service ensures that incoming data is from a trusted source by validating certificates and the data integrity with Azure authentication. The unprocessed raw data is then stored in an Azure Event Hub in the region the data will eventually be stored at rest. The type of data that is stored depends on the types of solutions that were imported and used to collect data. Then, the Log Analytics service processes the raw data and ingests it into the database."

-
-Open the Alert rules tab, and then use the add button.
-
-![In the Alert rules tab, choose Add Alert. Set your app as the resource to measure, provide a name for the alert, and choose a metric.](./media/alerts/01-set-metric.png)
-
-* Set the resource before the other properties. **Choose the ""(components)"" resource** if you want to set alerts on performance or usage metrics.
-* The name that you give to the alert must be unique within the resource group (not just your application).
-* Be careful to note the units in which you're asked to enter the threshold value.
-* If you check the box ""Email owners..."", alerts are sent by email to everyone who has access to this resource group. To expand this set of people, add them to the [resource group or subscription](../../azure-monitor/app/resources-roles-access-control.md) (not the resource).
-* If you specify ""Additional emails"", alerts are sent to those individuals or groups (whether or not you checked the ""email owners..."" box). 
-* Set a [webhook address](../../azure-monitor/platform/alerts-webhooks.md) if you have set up a web app that responds to alerts. It is called both when the alert is Activated and when it is Resolved. (But note that at present, query parameters are not passed through as webhook properties.)

-
-## See your alerts
-You get an email when an alert changes state between inactive and active. 
-
-The current state of each alert is shown in the Alert rules tab.
-
-There's a summary of recent activity in the alerts drop-down:
-
-![Alerts drop-down](./media/alerts/010-alert-drop.png)
-
-The history of state changes is in the Activity Log:
-
-![On the Overview tab, click Settings, Audit logs](./media/alerts/09-alerts.png)
-
-## How alerts work
-* An alert has three states: ""Never activated"", ""Activated"", and ""Resolved."" Activated means the condition you specified was true, when it was last evaluated.
-* A notification is generated when an alert changes state. (If the alert condition was already true when you created the alert, you might not get a notification until the condition goes false.)
-* Each notification generates an email if you checked the emails box, or provided email addresses. You can also look at the Notifications drop-down list.
-* An alert is evaluated each time a metric arrives, but not otherwise.
-* The evaluation aggregates the metric over the preceding period, and then compares it to the threshold to determine the new state.
-* The period that you choose specifies the interval over which metrics are aggregated. It doesn't affect how often the alert is evaluated: that depends on the frequency of arrival of metrics.
-* If no data arrives for a particular metric for some time, the gap has different effects on alert evaluation and on the charts in metric explorer. In metric explorer, if no data is seen for longer than the chart's sampling interval, the chart shows a value of 0. But an alert based on the same metric is not be reevaluated, and the alert's state remains unchanged. 
-  
-    When data eventually arrives, the chart jumps back to a non-zero value. The alert evaluates based on the data available for the period you specified. If the new data point is the only one available in the period, the aggregate is based just on that data point.
-* An alert can flicker frequently between alert and healthy states, even if you set a long period. This can happen if the metric value hovers around the threshold. There is no hysteresis in the threshold: the transition to alert happens at the same value as the transition to healthy.
-
-## What are good alerts to set?
-It depends on your application. To start with, it's best not to set too many metrics. Spend some time looking at your metric charts while your app is running, to get a feel for how it behaves normally. This practice helps you find ways to improve its performance. Then set up alerts to tell you when the metrics go outside the normal zone. 
-
-Popular alerts include:
-
-* [Browser metrics][client], especially Browser **page load times**, are good for web applications. If your page has many scripts, you should look for **browser exceptions**. In order to get these metrics and alerts, you have to set up [web page monitoring][client].
-* **Server response time** for the server side of web applications. As well as setting up alerts, keep an eye on this metric to see if it varies disproportionately with high request rates: variation might indicate that your app is running out of resources. 
-* **Server exceptions** - to see them, you have to do some [additional setup](../../azure-monitor/app/asp-net-exceptions.md).
-
-Don't forget that [proactive failure rate diagnostics](../../azure-monitor/app/proactive-failure-diagnostics.md) automatically monitor the rate at which your app responds to requests with failure codes.

-
-# Collect distributed traces from Go (Preview)
-
-Application Insights now supports distributed tracing of Go applications through integration with [OpenCensus](https://opencensus.io) and our new [local forwarder](./opencensus-local-forwarder.md). This article will walk you step-by-step through the process of setting up OpenCensus for Go and getting your trace data to Application Insights.
-
-## Prerequisites
-
-- You need an Azure Subscription.
-- Go should be installed, this article uses the version 1.11 [Go Download](https://golang.org/dl/).
-- Follow the instructions to install the [local forwarder as a Windows service](./opencensus-local-forwarder.md).
-
-If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) account before you begin.
-
-## Sign in to the Azure portal
-
-Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
-
-## Create Application Insights resource
-
-First you have to create an Application Insights resource which will generate an instrumentation key (ikey). The ikey is then used to configure the local forwarder to send distributed traces from your OpenCensus instrumented application, to Application Insights.   
-
-1. Select **Create a resource** > **Developer Tools** > **Application Insights**.
-
-   ![Adding Application Insights Resource](./media/opencensus-Go/0001-create-resource.png)
-
- > [!NOTE]
-   >If this is your first time creating an Application Insights resource you can learn more by visiting the [Create an Application Insights Resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/create-new-resource) article.
-
-   A configuration box appears; use the following table to fill out the input fields.
-
-   | Settings        | Value           | Description  |
-   | ------------- |:-------------|:-----|
-   | **Name**      | Globally Unique Value | Name that identifies the app you are monitoring |
-   | **Resource Group**     | myResourceGroup      | Name for the new resource group to host App Insights data |
-   | **Location** | East US | Choose a location near you, or near where your app is hosted |
-
-2. Click **Create**.
-
-## Configure local forwarder
-
-1. Select **Overview** > **Essentials** > Copy your application's **Instrumentation Key**.
-
-   ![Screenshot of instrumentation key](./media/opencensus-Go/0003-instrumentation-key.png)
-
-2. Edit your `LocalForwarder.config` file and add your instrumentation key. If you followed the instructions in the [pre-requisite](./opencensus-local-forwarder.md) the file is located at `C:\LF-WindowsServiceHost`
-
-    ```xml
-      <OpenCensusToApplicationInsights>
-        <!--
-          Instrumentation key to track telemetry to.
-          -->
-        <InstrumentationKey>{enter-instrumentation-key}</InstrumentationKey>
-      </OpenCensusToApplicationInsights>
-    
-      <!-- Describes aspects of processing Application Insights telemetry-->
-      <ApplicationInsights>
-        <LiveMetricsStreamInstrumentationKey>{enter-instrumentation-key}</LiveMetricsStreamInstrumentationKey>
-      </ApplicationInsights>
-    </LocalForwarderConfiguration>
-    ```
-
-3. Restart the application **Local Forwarder** service.
-
-## OpenCensus Go packages
-
-1. Install the Open Census packages for Go from the command line:
-
-    ```go
-    go get -u go.opencensus.io
-    go get -u contrib.go.opencensus.io/exporter/ocagent
-    ```
-
-2. Add the following code to a .go file and then build and run. (This example is derived from the official OpenCensus guidance with added code that facilitates the integration with the local forwarder)

-        
-        }
-     ```
-
-3. Once the simple go app is running navigate to `http://localhost:50030`. Each refresh of the browser will generate the text ""hello world"" accompanied by corresponding span data that is picked up by the local forwarder.
-
-4. To confirm that the **local forwarder** is picking up the traces check the `LocalForwarder.config` file. If you followed the steps in the [prerequisite](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-insights/local-forwarder), it will be located in `C:\LF-WindowsServiceHost`.
-
-    In the image below of the log file, you can see that prior to running the second script where we added an exporter `OpenCensus input BatchesReceived` was 0. Once we started running the updated script `BatchesReceived` incremented equal to the number of values we entered:
-    
-    ![New App Insights resource form](./media/opencensus-go/0004-batches-received.png)
-
-## Start monitoring in the Azure portal
-
-1. You can now reopen the Application Insights **Overview** page in the Azure portal, to view details about your currently running application. Select **Live Metric Stream**.
-
-   ![Screenshot of overview pane with live metric stream selected in red box](./media/opencensus-go/0005-overview-live-metrics-stream.png)
-
-2. If you run the second Go app again and start refreshing the browser for `http://localhost:50030`, you will see live trace data as it arrives in Application Insights from the local forwarder service.
-
-   ![Screenshot of live metric stream with performance data displayed](./media/opencensus-go/0006-stream.png)
-
-3. Navigate back to the **Overview** page and select **Application Map** for a visual layout of the dependency relationships and call timing between your application components.
-
-    ![Screenshot of basic application map](./media/opencensus-go/0007-application-map.png)
-
-    Since we were only tracing one method call, our application map isn't as interesting. But application map can scale to visualize far more distributed applications:
-
-   ![Application Map](media/opencensus-go/application-map.png)
-
-4. Select **Investigate Performance** to perform detailed performance analysis and determine the root cause of slow performance.
-
-    ![Screenshot of performance pane](./media/opencensus-go/0008-performance.png)
-
-5. Selecting **Samples** and then clicking on any of the samples that appear in the right-hand pane will launch the end-to-end transaction details experience. While our sample app will just show us a single event, a more complex application would allow you to explore the end-to-end transaction down to level of an individual event's call stack.

-# Local forwarder (Preview)
-
-Local forwarder is an agent that collects Application Insights or [OpenCensus](https://opencensus.io/) telemetry from a variety of SDKs and routes it to Application Insights. It's capable of running under Windows and Linux. You may also be able to run it under macOS, but that is not officially supported at this time.
-
-## Running local forwarder
-
-Local forwarder is an [open source project on GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-LocalForwarder/releases). There are a variety of ways to run local forwarder on multiple platforms.
-
-### Windows
-
-#### Windows Service
-
-The easiest way of running local forwarder under Windows is by installing it as a Windows Service. The release comes with a Windows Service executable (*WindowsServiceHost/Microsoft.LocalForwarder.WindowsServiceHost.exe*) which can be easily registered with the operating system.
-
-> [!NOTE]
-> The local forwarder service requires a minimum of .NET Framework 4.7. If you do not have .NET Framework 4.7 the service will install, but it won't start. To access the lastest version of the .NET Framework **[visit the .NET Framework download page](
-https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-framework-runtime/net472?utm_source=getdotnet&utm_medium=referral)**.
-
-1. Download the LF.WindowsServiceHost.zip file from the [local forwarder release page](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-LocalForwarder/releases) on GitHub.
-
-    ![Screenshot of local forwarder release download page](./media/opencensus-local-forwarder/001-local-forwarder-windows-service-host-zip.png)
-
-2. In this example for ease of demonstration, we will just extract the .zip file to the path `C:\LF-WindowsServiceHost`.
-
-    To register the service and configure it to start at system boot run the following from the command line as Administrator:
-
-    ```
-    sc create ""Local Forwarder"" binpath=""C:\LF-WindowsServiceHost\Microsoft.LocalForwarder.WindowsServiceHost.exe"" start=auto
-    ```
-    
-    You should receive a response of:
-    
-    `[SC] CreateService SUCCESS`
-    
-    To examine your new service via the Services GUI type ``services.msc``
-        
-     ![Screenshot of local forwarder service](./media/opencensus-local-forwarder/002-services.png)
-
-3. **Right-click** the new local forwarder and select **Start**. Your service will now enter a running state.
-
-4. By default the service is created without any recovery actions. You can **right-click** and select **Properties** > **Recovery** to configure automatic responses to a service failure.
-
-    Or if you prefer to set automatic recovery options programmatically for when failures occur, you can use:
-
-    ```
-    sc failure ""Local Forwarder"" reset= 432000 actions= restart/1000/restart/1000/restart/1000
-    ```
-
-5. In the same location as your ``Microsoft.LocalForwarder.WindowsServiceHost.exe`` file, which in this example is ``C:\LF-WindowsServiceHost`` there is a file called ``LocalForwarder.config``. This is an xml based file that allows you to adjust the configuration of your localforwader and specify the instrumentation key of the Application Insights resource you want your distributed tracing data forwarded. 
-
-    After editing the ``LocalForwarder.config`` file to add your instrumentation key, be sure to restart the **Local Forwarder Service** to allow your changes to take effect.
-    
-6. To confirm that your desired settings are in place and that the local forwarder is listening for trace data as expected check the ``LocalForwarder.log`` file. You should see results similar to the image below at the bottom of the file:
-
-    ![Screenshot of LocalForwarder.log file](./media/opencensus-local-forwarder/003-log-file.png)
-
-#### Console application
-
-For certain use cases, it might be beneficial to run local forwarder as a console application. The release comes with the following executable versions of the console host:
-* a framework-dependent .NET Core binary */ConsoleHost/publish/Microsoft.LocalForwarder.ConsoleHost.dll*. Running this binary requires a .NET Core runtime to be installed; refer to this download [page](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/2.1) for details.
-  ```batchfile
-  E:\uncdrop\ConsoleHost\publish>dotnet Microsoft.LocalForwarder.ConsoleHost.dll
-  ```
-* a self-contained .NET Core set of binaries for x86 and x64 platforms. These don't require .NET Core runtime to run. */ConsoleHost/win-x86/publish/Microsoft.LocalForwarder.ConsoleHost.exe*, */ConsoleHost/win-x64/publish/Microsoft.LocalForwarder.ConsoleHost.exe*.
-  ```batchfile
-  E:\uncdrop\ConsoleHost\win-x86\publish>Microsoft.LocalForwarder.ConsoleHost.exe
-  E:\uncdrop\ConsoleHost\win-x64\publish>Microsoft.LocalForwarder.ConsoleHost.exe
-  ```
-
-### Linux
-
-As with Windows, the release comes with the following executable versions of the console host:
-* a framework-dependent .NET Core binary */ConsoleHost/publish/Microsoft.LocalForwarder.ConsoleHost.dll*. Running this binary requires a .NET Core runtime to be installed; refer to this download [page](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/2.1) for details.
-
-```batchfile
-dotnet Microsoft.LocalForwarder.ConsoleHost.dll
-```
-
-* a self-contained .NET Core set of binaries for linux-64. This one doesn't require .NET Core runtime to run. */ConsoleHost/linux-x64/publish/Microsoft.LocalForwarder.ConsoleHost*.
-
-```batchfile
-user@machine:~/ConsoleHost/linux-x64/publish$ sudo chmod +x Microsoft.LocalForwarder.ConsoleHost
-user@machine:~/ConsoleHost/linux-x64/publish$ ./Microsoft.LocalForwarder.ConsoleHost
-```
-
-Many Linux users will want to run local forwarder as a daemon. Linux systems come with a variety of solutions for service management, like Upstart, sysv, or systemd. Whatever your particular version is, you can use it to run local forwarder in a way that is most appropriate for your scenario.
-
-As an example, let's create a daemon service using systemd. We'll use the framework-dependent version, but the same can be done for a self-contained one as well.
-
-* create the following service file named *localforwarder.service* and place it into */lib/systemd/system*.
-This sample assumes your user name is SAMPLE_USER and you've copied local forwarder framework-dependent binaries (from */ConsoleHost/publish*) to */home/SAMPLE_USER/LOCALFORWARDER_DIR*.
-
-```
-# localforwarder.service
-# Place this file into /lib/systemd/system/
-# Use 'systemctl enable localforwarder' to start the service automatically on each boot
-# Use 'systemctl start localforwarder' to start the service immediately

-```
-
-* Run the following command to instruct systemd to start local forwarder on every boot
-
-```
-systemctl enable localforwarder
-```
-
-* Run the following command to instruct systemd to start local forwarder immediately
-
-```
-systemctl start localforwarder
-```
-
-* Monitor the service by inspecting **.log* files in the /home/SAMPLE_USER/LOCALFORWARDER_DIR directory.
-
-### Mac
-Local forwarder may work with macOS, but it is currently not officially supported.
-
-### Self-hosting
-Local forwarder is also distributed as a .NET Standard NuGet package, allowing you to host it inside your own .NET application.
-
-```csharp
-using Library;
-...
-Host host = new Host();
-
-// see section below on configuring local forwarder
-string configuration = ...;
-    
-host.Run(config, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));
-...
-host.Stop();
-```
-
-## Configuring local forwarder
-
-* When running one of local forwarder's own hosts (Console Host or Windows Service Host), you will find **LocalForwarder.config** placed next to the binary.
-* When self-hosting the local forwarder NuGet, the configuration of the same format must be provided in code (see section on self-hosting). For the configuration syntax, check the [LocalForwarder.config](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-LocalForwarder/blob/master/src/ConsoleHost/LocalForwarder.config) in the GitHub repository. 
-
-> [!NOTE]
-> Configuration may change from release to release, so pay attention to which version you're using.
-
-## Monitoring local forwarder
-
-Traces are written out to the file system next to the executable that runs local forwarder (look for **.log* files). You can place a file with a name of *NLog.config* next to the executable to provide your own configuration in place of the default one. See [documentation](https://github.com/NLog/NLog/wiki/Configuration-file#configuration-file-format) for the description of the format.
-
-If no configuration file is provided (which is the default), Local forwarder will use the default configuration, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-LocalForwarder/blob/master/src/Common/NLog.config).

If a user would like to see their OTP codes in screenshots or allow other apps to capture the Authenticator's screen, they can do so by enabling the ""Screen Capture"" setting in their Authenticator app and then restarting the app. |
 | What data does the Authenticator store on my behalf and how can I delete it? | The Microsoft Authenticator app collects three types of information:<ul><li>Account info you provide when you add your account. This data can be removed by removing your account.</li><li>Diagnostic log data that stays only in the app until you select **Send Logs** the app's **Help** menu to send logs to Microsoft. These log files contain personal data, like your email addresses (such as, alain@contoso.com), server or IP addresses, and device data (such as, device name and operating system version), with the personal data limited to info necessary to help troubleshoot app issues. You can view these log files in the app at any time to see the info being gathered. If you send the log files, the Authentication app engineers can use it to troubleshoot customer-reported issues.</li><li>Non-personally identifiable usage data, such ""started add account flow/successfully added account,"" or ""notification approved."" This data is an integral part of our engineering decisions and helps us determine what features are important to you, and where improvements need to be made in the form of updates to the apps. You, as an app user, see a notification of this data collection on first launch of the app, and are informed that it can be turned off on the app's **Settings** page. You can enable or disable this setting at any time.</li></ul> |
 | What are the codes in the app for? | When you open the Microsoft Authenticator app, you'll see your added accounts as tiles.<li>On an iOS device, your work or school accounts and your personal Microsoft accounts will have six – or eight - digit numbers visible in the full screen view of the account (accessed by tapping on the account tile).<br><br>![Accounts screen in the app](./media/user-help-auth-app-faq/auth-app-accounts.png)<li>For other accounts on an iOS device and all accounts on an Android device, you'll see a six- or eight-digit numbers in the Accounts page of the app. You'll use these codes as verification that you are who you say you are. After you sign in with your username and password, you'll type in the verification code that's associated with that account. For example, if you're Katy signing in to your Contoso account and you are using an iOS device, you'd tap on the account tile and then use the verification code to verify your identity.

 | Why does the number next to the code keep counting down? | You might see a 30-second timer counting down next to your active verification code.

-number of reasons why you may need to re-register that node in the future:
+- **Certificate renewal.** For versions of Windows Server before Windows Server 2019, each node automatically negotiates a unique certificate for authentication that expires after one year. If a certificate expires without renewal, the node is unable to communicate with Azure Automation and is marked `Unresponsive`. Currently, the PowerShell DSC registration protocol can't automatically renew certificates when they are nearing expiration, and you must re-register the nodes after a year's time. Before re-registering, ensure that each node is running WMF 5 RTM.

Currently, the PowerShell DSC registration protocol cannot automatically renew certificates when they are nearing expiration, so you need to re-register the nodes after a year's time. Before re-registering, ensure that each node is running Windows Management Framework 5.0 RTM. If a node's authentication certificate expires, and the node is not re-registered, the node is unable to communicate with Azure Automation and is marked 'Unresponsive.' Re-registration performed 90 days or less from the certificate expiration time, or at any point after the certificate expiration time, will result in a new certificate being generated and used.  A resolution to this issue is included in Windows Server 2019 and later.
-- To change any [PowerShell DSC Local Configuration Manager values](/powershell/scripting/dsc/managing-nodes/metaConfig4) that were set during initial registration of the node, such as ConfigurationMode.

+# How to create alerts from Azure Monitor for VMs
+[Alerts in Azure Monitor](../platform/alerts-overview.md) proactively notify you of interesting data and patterns in your monitoring data. Azure Monitor for VMs does not include pre-configured alert rules, but you can create your own based on data that it collects. This article provides guidance on creating alert rules, including a set of sample queries.
+
+
+## Alert rule types
+Azure Monitor has [different types of alert rules](../platform/alerts-overview.md#what-you-can-alert-on) based on the data being used to create the alert. All data collected by Azure Monitor for VMs is stored in Azure Monitor Logs which supports [log alerts](../platform/alerts-log.md). You cannot currently use [metric alerts](../platform/alerts-log.md) with performance data collected from Azure Monitor for VMs because the data is not collected into Azure Monitor Metrics. To collect data for metric alerts, install the [diagnostics extension](../platform/diagnostics-extension-overview.md) for Windows VMs or the [Telegraf agent](../platform/collect-custom-metrics-linux-telegraf.md) for Linux VMs to collect performance data into Metrics.
+
+There are two types of log alerts in Azure Monitor:
+
+- [Number of results alerts](../platform/alerts-unified-log.md#number-of-results-alert-rules) create a single alert when a query returns at least a specified number of records. These are ideal for non-numeric data such and Windows and Syslog events collected by the [Log Analytics agent](../platform/log-analytics-agent.md) or for analyzing performance trends across multiple computers.
+- [Metric measurement alerts](../platform/alerts-unified-log.md#metric-measurement-alert-rules) create a separate alert for each record in a query that has a value that exceeds a threshold defined in the alert rule. These alert rules are ideal for performance data collected by Azure Monitor for VMs since they can create individual alerts for each computer.
+
+
+## Alert rule walkthrough
+This section walks through the creation of a metric measurement alert rule using performance data from Azure Monitor for VMs. You can use this basic process with a variety of log queries to alert on different performance counters.
+
+Start by creating a new alert rule following the procedure in [Create, view, and manage log alerts using Azure Monitor](../platform/alerts-log.md). For the **Resource**, select the Log Analytics workspace that Azure Monitor VMs uses in your subscription. Since the target resource for log alert rules is always a Log Analytics workspace, the log query must include any filter for particular virtual machines or virtual machine scale sets. 
+
+For the **Condition** of the alert rule, use one of the queries in the [section below](#sample-alert-queries) as the **Search query**. The query must return a numeric property called *AggregatedValue*. It should summarize the data by computer so that you can create a separate alert for each virtual machine that exceeds the threshold.
+
+In the **Alert logic**, select **Metric measurement** and then provide a **Threshold value**. In **Trigger Alert Based On**, specify how many times the threshold must be exceeded before an alert is created. For example, you probably don't care if the processor exceeds a threshold once and then returns to normal, but you do care if it continues to exceed the threshold over multiple consecutive measurements.
+
+The **Evaluated based on** section defines how often the query is run and the time window for the query. In the example shown below, the query will run every 15 minutes and evaluate performance values collected over the previous 15 minutes.
+
+
+![Metric measurement alert rule](media/vminsights-alerts/metric-measurement-alert.png)
+
+## Sample alert queries
+The following queries can be used with a metric measurement alert rule using performance data collected by Azure Monitor for VMs. Each summarizes data by computer so that an alert is created for each computer with a value that exceeds the threshold.

 # Azure Monitor for VMs Generally Available (GA) Frequently Asked Questions
-
-This General Availability FAQ covers changes that are happening in Azure Monitor for VMs as we prepare for our GA release. 
+This General Availability FAQ covers changes that were made in Q4 2019 and Q1 2020 as we prepared for GA.
 
 ## Updates for Azure Monitor for VMs
+We released a new version of Azure Monitor for VMs in January 2020 ahead of our GA announcement. Customers enabling Azure Monitor for VMs will now receive the GA version, but existing customers using the version of Azure Monitor for VMs from Q4 2019 and earlier will be prompted to upgrade. This FAQ offers guidance to perform an upgrade at scale if you have large deployments across multiple workspaces.
 
-We have released a new version of Azure Monitor for VMs. Customers enabling Azure Monitors for VMs will now receive the new version, but existing customers already using Azure Monitor for VMs will be prompted to upgrade. This FAQ and our documentation offers guidance to perform an upgrade at scale if you have large deployments across multiple workspaces.
 
 With this upgrade, Azure Monitor for VMs performance data are stored in the same *InsightsMetrics* table as [Azure Monitor for containers](container-insights-overview.md), which makes it easier for you to query the two data sets. Also, you are able to store more diverse data sets that we could not store in the table previously used. 
 
 Our performance views are now using the data we store in the *InsightsMetrics* table.  If you have not yet upgraded to use the latest VMInsights solution on your workspace, your charts will no longer display information.  You can upgrade from our **Get Started** page as described below.
 
-We realize that asking existing customers to upgrade causes disruption to their workflow, which is why we have chosen to do this now while in Public Preview rather than later after GA.
-
 
 ## What is changing?
-
 We have released a new solution, named VMInsights, that includes additional capabilities for data collection along with a new location for storing this data in your Log Analytics workspace. 
 
 In the past, we enabled the ServiceMap solution on your workspace and setup performance counters in your Log Analytics workspace to send the data to the *Perf* table. This new solution sends the data to a table named *InsightsMetrics* that is also used by Azure Monitor for containers. This table schema allows us to store additional metrics and service data sets that are not compatible with the *Perf* table format.
@@ -88,10 +84,6 @@ No, the two solutions share the map data sets that we store in `VMComputer` (for
 
 No, the two solutions share the map data sets that we store in `VMComputer` (formerly ServiceMapComputer_CL), `VMProcess` (formerly ServiceMapProcess_CL), `VMConnection`, and `VMBoundPort`. If you remove one of the solutions, these data sets notice that there is still a solution in place that uses the data and it remains in the Log Analytics workspace. You need to remove both solutions from your workspace in order for the data to be removed from it.
 
-## When will this update be released?
-
-We expect to release the update for Azure Monitor for VMs in early January 2020. As we get closer to the release date in January, we'll post updates here and present notifications in the Azure portal when you open Azure Monitor.
-
 ## Health feature is in limited public preview
 
 We have received a lot of great feedback from customers about our VM Health feature set. There is a lot of interest around this feature and excitement over its potential for supporting monitoring workflows. We are planning to make a series of changes to add functionality and address the feedback we have received. "

-## Alerts  
 
-Performance metrics enabled as part of Azure Monitor for VMs do not include pre-configured alert rules. However, we may only collect and store a subset of the performance metrics you require in the Log Analytics workspace. If your monitoring strategy requires analysis or alerting that includes other performance metrics in order to effectively evaluate capacity or health of the virtual machine, or you need the flexibility to specify your own alerting criteria or logic, you can configure [collection of those performance counters](../platform/data-sources-performance-counters.md) in Log Analytics and define [log alerts](../platform/alerts-log.md). While Log Analytics allows you to perform complex analysis with other data types, and provide longer retention to support trend analysis, metrics on the other hand, are lightweight and capable of supporting near real-time scenarios. They are collected by the [Azure Diagnostic agent](../../virtual-machines/windows/monitor.md) and stored in the Azure Monitor metrics store, allowing you to create alerts with lower latency and at a lower cost.
-
-Review the overview of [collection of metrics and logs with Azure Monitor](../platform/data-platform.md) to further understand the fundamental differences and other considerations before configuring collection of these additional metrics and alert rules.

+# How to create alerts from Azure Monitor for VMs
+[Alerts in Azure Monitor](../platform/alerts-overview.md) proactively notify you of interesting data and patterns in your monitoring data. Azure Monitor for VMs does not include pre-configured alert rules, but you can create your own based on data that it collects. This article provides guidance on creating alert rules, including a set of sample queries.
+
+
+## Alert rule types
+Azure Monitor has [different types of alert rules](../platform/alerts-overview.md#what-you-can-alert-on) based on the data being used to create the alert. All data collected by Azure Monitor for VMs is stored in Azure Monitor Logs which supports [log alerts](../platform/alerts-log.md). You cannot currently use [metric alerts](../platform/alerts-log.md) with performance data collected from Azure Monitor for VMs because the data is not collected into Azure Monitor Metrics. To collect data for metric alerts, install the [diagnostics extension](../platform/diagnostics-extension-overview.md) for Windows VMs or the [Telegraf agent](../platform/collect-custom-metrics-linux-telegraf.md) for Linux VMs to collect performance data into Metrics.
+
+There are two types of log alerts in Azure Monitor:
+
+- [Number of results alerts](../platform/alerts-unified-log.md#number-of-results-alert-rules) create a single alert when a query returns at least a specified number of records. These are ideal for non-numeric data such and Windows and Syslog events collected by the [Log Analytics agent](../platform/log-analytics-agent.md) or for analyzing performance trends across multiple computers.
+- [Metric measurement alerts](../platform/alerts-unified-log.md#metric-measurement-alert-rules) create a separate alert for each record in a query that has a value that exceeds a threshold defined in the alert rule. These alert rules are ideal for performance data collected by Azure Monitor for VMs since they can create individual alerts for each computer.
+
+
+## Alert rule details
+Since the target resource for log alert rules is always a Log Analytics workspace, the log query must include any filter for particular virtual machines or virtual machine scale sets. For metric measurement alert rules, summarize the query results by computer in order to evaluate each separately. 
+
+Start by creating a new alert rule following the procedure in [Create, view, and manage log alerts using Azure Monitor](../platform/alerts-log.md). For the **Resource**, select the Log Analytics workspace that Azure Monitor VMs uses in your subscription.
+
+For the **Condition** of the alert rule, provide one of the queries in the section below as the **Search query**. The query must return a numeric property called *AggregatedValue*. It should summarize the data by computer so that you can create a separate alert for each virtual machine that exceeds the threshold.
+
+In the **Alert logic**, select **Metric measurement** and then provide a **Threshold value**. In **Trigger Alert Based On**, specify how many times the threshold must be exceeded before an alert is created. For example, you probably don't care if the processor exceeds a threshold once and then returns to normal, but you do care if it continues to exceed the threshold over multiple measurements.
+
+The **Evaluated based on** section defines how often the query is run and the time window for the query. In the example shown below, the query will run every 15 minutes and evalute performance collected over the previous 15 minutes.
+
+
+![Metric measurement alert rule](media/vminsights-alerts/metric-measurement-alert.png)
+
+## Sample alert queries
+The following queries can be used with a metric measurement alert rule using performance data collected by Azure Monitor for VMs. Each summarizes data by computer so that an alert is created for each computer with a value that exceeds the threshold.

+This General Availability FAQ covers changes that were made in Q4 2019 and Q1 2020 as we prepared for GA.
 
 ## Updates for Azure Monitor for VMs
+We released a new version of Azure Monitor for VMs in January 2020 ahead of our GA announcement. Customers enabling Azure Monitor for VMs will now receive the GA version, but existing customers using the version of Azure Monitor for VMs from Q4 2019 and earlier will be prompted to upgrade. This FAQ offers guidance to perform an upgrade at scale if you have large deployments across multiple workspaces.
 
-We have released a new version of Azure Monitor for VMs. Customers enabling Azure Monitors for VMs will now receive the new version, but existing customers already using Azure Monitor for VMs will be prompted to upgrade. This FAQ and our documentation offers guidance to perform an upgrade at scale if you have large deployments across multiple workspaces.
 
 With this upgrade, Azure Monitor for VMs performance data are stored in the same *InsightsMetrics* table as [Azure Monitor for containers](container-insights-overview.md), which makes it easier for you to query the two data sets. Also, you are able to store more diverse data sets that we could not store in the table previously used. 
 
 Our performance views are now using the data we store in the *InsightsMetrics* table.  If you have not yet upgraded to use the latest VMInsights solution on your workspace, your charts will no longer display information.  You can upgrade from our **Get Started** page as described below.
 
-We realize that asking existing customers to upgrade causes disruption to their workflow, which is why we have chosen to do this now while in Public Preview rather than later after GA.
-
 
 ## What is changing?
-
 We have released a new solution, named VMInsights, that includes additional capabilities for data collection along with a new location for storing this data in your Log Analytics workspace. 
 
 In the past, we enabled the ServiceMap solution on your workspace and setup performance counters in your Log Analytics workspace to send the data to the *Perf* table. This new solution sends the data to a table named *InsightsMetrics* that is also used by Azure Monitor for containers. This table schema allows us to store additional metrics and service data sets that are not compatible with the *Perf* table format.

 No, the two solutions share the map data sets that we store in `VMComputer` (formerly ServiceMapComputer_CL), `VMProcess` (formerly ServiceMapProcess_CL), `VMConnection`, and `VMBoundPort`. If you remove one of the solutions, these data sets notice that there is still a solution in place that uses the data and it remains in the Log Analytics workspace. You need to remove both solutions from your workspace in order for the data to be removed from it.
 
-## When will this update be released?
-
-We expect to release the update for Azure Monitor for VMs in early January 2020. As we get closer to the release date in January, we'll post updates here and present notifications in the Azure portal when you open Azure Monitor.

 ## Health feature is in limited public preview
 
 We have received a lot of great feedback from customers about our VM Health feature set. There is a lot of interest around this feature and excitement over its potential for supporting monitoring workflows. We are planning to make a series of changes to add functionality and address the feedback we have received. "

-## Alerts  
 
-Performance metrics enabled as part of Azure Monitor for VMs do not include pre-configured alert rules. However, we may only collect and store a subset of the performance metrics you require in the Log Analytics workspace. If your monitoring strategy requires analysis or alerting that includes other performance metrics in order to effectively evaluate capacity or health of the virtual machine, or you need the flexibility to specify your own alerting criteria or logic, you can configure [collection of those performance counters](../platform/data-sources-performance-counters.md) in Log Analytics and define [log alerts](../platform/alerts-log.md). While Log Analytics allows you to perform complex analysis with other data types, and provide longer retention to support trend analysis, metrics on the other hand, are lightweight and capable of supporting near real-time scenarios. They are collected by the [Azure Diagnostic agent](../../virtual-machines/windows/monitor.md) and stored in the Azure Monitor metrics store, allowing you to create alerts with lower latency and at a lower cost.
-
-Review the overview of [collection of metrics and logs with Azure Monitor](../platform/data-platform.md) to further understand the fundamental differences and other considerations before configuring collection of these additional metrics and alert rules.

+# Troubleshooting problems in Azure Monitor alerts 
+
+This article discusses common problems in Azure Monitor alerting.
+
+Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when important conditions are found in your monitoring data. They allow you to identify and address issues before the users of your system notice them. For more information on alerting, see [Overview of alerts in Microsoft Azure](alerts-overview.md).
+
+## Action or notification on my alert did not work as expected
+
+If you can see a fired alert in the Azure portal, but have an issue with some of its actions or notifications, see the following sections.
+
+## Expected an email, but did not receive it
+
+If you can see a fired alert in the Azure portal, but did not receive the email that you have configured about it, follow these steps: 
+
+1. **Was the email suppressed by an [action rule](alerts-action-rules.md)**? 
+
+    Check by clicking on the fired alert in the portal, and look at the history tab for suppressed [action groups](action-groups.md): 
+
+    ![Alert action rule suppression history](media/alerts-troubleshoot/history-action-rule.png)
+
+1. **Is the type of action ""Email Azure Resource Manager Role""?**
+
+    This action only looks at Azure Resource Manager role assignments that are at the subscription scope, and of type *User*.  Make sure that you have assigned the role at the subscription level, and not at the resource level or resource group level.
+
+1. **Are your email server and mailbox accepting external emails?**
+
+    Verify that emails from these three addresses are not blocked:
+      - azure-noreply@microsoft.com  
+      - azureemail-noreply@microsoft.com
+      - alerts-noreply@mail.windowsazure.com
+
+    It is common that internal mailing lists or distribution lists block emails from external email addresses. You need to whitelist the above email addresses.  
+    To test, add a regular work email address (not a mailing list) to the action group and see if alerts arrive to that email. 
+
+1. **Was the email processed by inbox rules or a spam filter?** 
+
+    Verify that there are no inbox rules that delete those emails or move them to a side folder. For example, inbox rules could catch specific senders or specific words in the subject.
+
+    Also, check:
+    
+      - the spam settings of your email client (like Outlook, Gmail)
+      - the sender limits / spam settings / quarantine settings of your email server (like Exchange, Office 365, G-suite)
+      - the settings of your email security appliance, if any (like Barracuda, Cisco). 
+
+1. **Have you accidentally unsubscribed from the action group?** 
+
+    The alert emails provide a link to unsubscribe from the action group. To check if you have accidentally unsubscribed from this action group, either:
+
+    1. Open the action group in the portal and check the Status column:
+
+    ![action group status column](media/alerts-troubleshoot/action-group-status.png)
+
+    2. Search your email for the unsubscribe confirmation:
+
+    ![unsubscribed from alert action group](media/alerts-troubleshoot/unsubscribe-action-group.png)
+
+    To subscribe again – either use the link in the unsubscribe confirmation email you have received, or remove the email address from the action group, and then add it back again. 
+ 
+1. **Have you been rated limited due to many emails going to a single email address?** 
+
+    Email is [rate limited](alerts-rate-limiting.md) to no more than 100 emails every hour to each email address. If you pass this threshold, additional email notifications are dropped.  Check if you have received a message indicating that your email address has been temporarily rate limited: 
+ 
+   ![Email rate limited](media/alerts-troubleshoot/email-paused.png)
+
+   If you would like to receive high-volume of notifications without rate limiting, consider using a different action, such as webhook, logic app, Azure function, or automation runbooks, none of which are rate limited. 
+
+## Expected an SMS, a voice call, or a push notification, but did not receive it
+
+If you can see a fired alert in the portal, but did not receive the SMS, voice call or push notification that you have configured about it, follow these steps: 
+
+1. **Was the action suppressed by an [action rule](alerts-action-rules.md)?** 
+
+    Check by clicking on the fired alert in the portal, and look at the history tab for suppressed [action groups](action-groups.md): 
+
+    ![Alert action rule suppression history](media/alerts-troubleshoot/history-action-rule.png)
+
+   If that was unintentional, you can modify, disable, or delete the action rule.
+ 
+1. **SMS / voice:  Is your phone number correct?**
+
+   Check the SMS action for typos in the country code or phone number. 
+ 
+1. **SMS / voice: have you been rate limited?** 
+
+    SMS and voice calls are rate limited to no more than one notification every five minutes per phone number. If you pass this threshold, the notifications will be dropped. 
+
+      - Voice call – check your call history and see if you had a different call from Azure in the preceding five minutes. 
+      - SMS - check your SMS history for a message indicating that your phone number has been rate limited. 
+
+    If you would like to receive high-volume of notifications without rate limiting, consider using a different action, such as webhook, logic app, Azure function, or automation runbooks, none of which are rate limited. 
+ 
+1. **SMS: Have you accidentally unsubscribed from the action group?**
+
+    Open your SMS history and check if you have opted out of SMS delivery from this specific action group (using the DISABLE action_group_short_name reply) or from all action groups (using the  STOP reply). To subscribe again, either send the relevant SMS command (ENABLE action_group_short_name or START), or remove the SMS action from the action group, and then add it back again.  For more information, see [SMS alert behavior in action groups](alerts-sms-behavior.md).
+
+1. **Have you accidentally blocked the notifications on your phone?**
+
+   Most mobile phones allow you to block calls or SMS from specific phone numbers or short codes, or to block push notifications from specific apps (such as the Azure mobile app). To check if you accidentally blocked the notifications on your phone, search the documentation specific for your phone operating system and model, or test with a different phone and phone number. 
+
+## Expected another type of action to trigger, but it did not 
+
+If you can see a fired alert in the portal, but its configured action did not trigger, follow these steps: 
+
+1. **Was the action suppressed by an action rule?** 
+
+    Check by clicking on the fired alert in the portal, and look at the history tab for suppressed [action groups](action-groups.md): 
+
+    ![Alert action rule suppression history](media/alerts-troubleshoot/history-action-rule.png)
+ 
+    If that was unintentional, you can modify, disable, or delete the action rule. 
+
+1. **Did a webhook not trigger?**
+
+    1. **Have the source IP addresses been blocked?**
+    
+       Whitelist the [IP addresses](action-groups.md#action-specific-information) that the webhook is called from.
+
+    1. **Does your webhook endpoint work correctly?**
+
+       Verify the webhook endpoint you have configured is correct and the endpoint is working correctly. Check your webhook logs or instrument its code so you could investigate (for example, log the incoming payload). 
+
+    1. **Are you calling Slack or Microsoft Teams?**  
+    Each of these endpoints expects a specific JSON format. Follow [these instructions](action-groups-logic-app.md) to configure a logic app action instead.
+
+    1. **Did your webhook became unresponsive or returned errors?** 
+
+        Our timeout period for a webhook response is 10 seconds. The webhook call will be retried up to two additional times when the following HTTP status codes are returned: 408, 429, 503, 504, or when the HTTP endpoint does not respond. The first retry happens after 10 seconds. The second and final retry happens after 100 seconds. If the second retry fails, the endpoint will not be called again for 30 minutes for any action group.
+
+## Action or notification happened more than once 
+
+If you have received a notification for an alert (such as an email or an SMS) more than once, or the alert's action (such as webhook or Azure function) was triggered multiple times, follow these steps: 
+
+1. **Is it really the same alert?** 
+
+    In some cases, multiple similar alerts are fired at around the same time. So, it might just seem like the same alert triggered its actions multiple times. For example, an activity log alert rule might be configured to fire both when an event has started, and when it has finished (succeeded or failed), by not filtering on the event status field. 
+
+    To check if these actions or notifications came from different alerts, examine the alert details, such as its timestamp and either the alert id or its correlation id. Alternatively, check the list of fired alerts in the portal. If that is the case, you would need to adapt the alert rule logic or otherwise configure the alert source. 
+
+1. **Does the action repeat in multiple action groups?** 
+
+    When an alert is fired, each of its action groups is processed independently. So, if an action (such as an email address) appears in multiple triggered action groups, it would be called once per action group. 
+
+    To check which action groups were triggered, check the alert history tab. You would see there both action groups defined in the alert rule, and action groups added to the alert by action rules: 
+
+    ![Action repeated in multiple action groups](media/alerts-troubleshoot/action-repeated-multi-action-groups.png)
+
+## Action or notification has an unexpected content
+
+If you have received the alert, but believe some of its fields are missing or incorrect, follow these steps: 
+
+1. **Did you pick the correct format for the action?** 
+
+    Each action type (email, webhook, etc.) has two formats – the default, legacy format, and the [newer common schema format](alerts-common-schema.md). When you create an action group, you specify the format you want per action – different actions in the action groups may have different formats. 
+
+    For example, for webhook action: 
+
+    ![webhook action schema option](media/alerts-troubleshoot/webhook.png)
+
+    Check if the format specified at the action level is what you expect. For example, you may have developed code that responds to alerts (webhook, function, logic app, etc.), expecting one format, but later in the action you or another person specified a different format.  
+
+    Also, check the payload format (JSON) for [activity log alerts](activity-log-alerts-webhook.md), for [log search alerts](alerts-log-webhook.md) (both Application Insights and log analytics), for [metric alerts](alerts-metric-near-real-time.md#payload-schema), for the [common alert schema](alerts-common-schema-definitions.md), and for the deprecated [classic metric alerts](alerts-webhooks.md).
+
+ 
+1. **Activity log alerts: Is the information available in the activity log?** 
+
+    [Activity log alerts](activity-log-alerts.md) are alerts that are based on events written to the Azure Activity Log, such as events about creating, updating or deleting Azure resources, service health and resource health events, or findings from Azure Advisor and Azure Policy. If you have received an alert based on the activity log but some fields that you need are missing or incorrect, first check the events in the activity log itself. If the Azure resource did not write the fields you are looking for in its activity log event, those fields will not be included in the corresponding alert. 
+
+## Action rule is not working as expected 
+
+If you can see a fired alert in the portal, but a related action rule did not work as expected, follow these steps: 
+
+1. **Is the action rule enabled?** 
+
+    Check the action rule status column to verify that the related action role is enabled. 
+
+    ![graphic](media/alerts-troubleshoot/action-rule-status.png) 
+
+    If it is not enabled, you can enable the action rule by selecting it and clicking Enable. 
+
+1. **Is it a service health alert?** 
+
+    Service health alerts (monitor service = ""Service Health"") are not affected by action rules. 
+
+1. **Did the action rule act on your alert?** 
+
+    Check if the action rule has processed your alert by clicking on the fired alert in the portal, and look at the history tab.
+
+    Here is an example of action rule suppressing all action groups: 
+ 
+     ![Alert action rule suppression history](media/alerts-troubleshoot/history-action-rule.png)
+
+    Here is an example of an action rule adding another action group:
+
+    ![Action repeated in multiple action groups](media/alerts-troubleshoot/action-repeated-multi-action-groups.png)
+ 
+
+1. **Does the action rule scope and filter match the fired alert?** 
+
+    If you think the action rule should have fired but didn't, or that it shouldn't have fired but it did, carefully examine the action rule scope and filter conditions versus the properties of the fired alert. 
+
+
+## How to find the alert id of a fired alert
+
+When opening a case about a specific fired alert (such as – if you did not receive its email notification), you will need to provide the alert id. 
+
+To locate it, follow these steps:
+
+1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the list of fired alerts, and find that specific alert. You can use the filters to help you locate it. 
+
+1. Click on the alert to open the alert details. 
+
+1. Scroll down in the alert fields of the first tab (the summary tab) until you locate it, and copy it. That field also includes a ""Copy to clipboard"" helper button you can use.  
+
+    ![find alert id](media/alerts-troubleshoot/get-alert-id.png)
+
+## Problem creating, updating, or deleting action rules in the Azure portal
+
+If you received an error while trying to create, update or delete an [action rule](alerts-action-rules.md), follow these steps: 
+
+1. **Did you receive a permission error?**  
+
+    You should either have the [Monitoring Contributor built-in role](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#monitoring-contributor), or the specific permissions related to action rules and alerts.
+
+1. **Did you verify the action rule parameters?**  
+
+    Check the [action rule documentation](alerts-action-rules.md), or the [action rule PowerShell Set-AzActionRule](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.alertsmanagement/Set-AzActionRule?view=azps-3.5.0) command. 
+
+
+## Next steps
+
+Go back to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to check if you've solved your issue with any of the advice above"

-# Export or import your provisioning configuration by using the Microsoft Graph API
-
-You can use the Microsoft Graph API and the Microsoft Graph Explorer to export your User Provisioning attribute mappings and schema to a JSON file and import it back into Azure AD. You can also use the steps captured here to create a backup of your provisioning configuration. 
-
+# Export your provisioning configuration and roll back to a known good state
+
+## Export and import your provisioning configuration from the Azure portal
+### How can I export my provisioning configuration?
+To export your configuration:
+1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the left navigation panel, select **Azure Active Directory**.
+2. In the **Azure Active Directory** pane, select **Enterprise applications** and choose your application.
+3. In the left navigation pane, select **provisioning**. From the provisioning configuration page, click on **attribute mappings**, then **show advanced options**, and finally **review your schema**. This will take you to the schema editor. 
+5. Click on download in the command bar at the top of the page to download your schema.
+
+### Disaster recovery - roll back to a known good state
+Exporting and saving your configuration allows you to roll back to a previous version of your configuration. We recommend exporting your provisioning configuration and saving it for later use anytime you make a change to your attribute mappings or scoping filters. All you need to do is open up the JSON file that you downloaded in the steps above, copy the entire contents of the JSON file, replace the entire contents of the JSON payload in the schema editor, and then save. If there is an active provisioning cycle, it will complete and the next cycle will use the updated schema. The next cycle will also be an initial cycle, which reevaluates every user and group based on the new configuration. 
 ## Step 1: Retrieve your Provisioning App Service Principal ID (Object ID)
 
 1. Launch the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and navigate to the Properties section of your  provisioning application. For e.g. if you want to export your *Workday to AD User Provisioning application* mapping navigate to the Properties section of that app. "

-## Meet Log Analytics
-Log Analytics is a web tool used to write and execute Azure Monitor log queries. Open it by selecting **Logs** in the Azure Monitor menu. It starts with a new blank query.
+## Open Log Analytics
+To use Log Analytics, you need to be signed in to an Azure account. If you don't have an Azure account, [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
 
-![Home page](media/get-started-portal/homepage.png)
+To complete most of the steps in this tutorial, you can use [this demo environment](https://portal.loganalytics.io/demo), which includes plenty of sample data. With the demo environment, you won't be able to save queries or pin results to a dashboard.
 
-## Firewall requirements
-To use Log Analytics, your browser requires access to the following addresses. If your browser is accessing the Azure portal through a firewall, you must enable access to these addresses.
+You can also use your own environment, if you're using Azure Monitor to collect log data on at least one Azure resource. To open a Log Analytics workspace, in your Azure Monitor left navigation, select **Logs**.

-
-## Basic queries
-Queries can be used to search terms, identify trends, analyze patterns, and provide many other insights based on your data. Start with a basic query:
-
-```Kusto
-Event | search ""error""
-```
-
-This query searches the _Event_ table for records that contain the term _error_ in any property.
-
-Queries can start with either a table name or a [search](/azure/kusto/query/searchoperator) command. The above example starts with the table name _Event_, which retrieves all records from the Event table. The pipe (|) character separates commands, so the output of the first one serves as the input of the following command. You can add any number of commands to a single query.
-
-Another way to write that same query would be:
-
-```Kusto
-search in (Event) ""error""
-```
-
-In this example, **search** is scoped to the _Event_ table, and all records in that table are searched for the term _error_.
+## Understand the schema
+A *schema* is a collection of tables grouped under logical categories. The Demo schema has several categories from monitoring solutions. For example, the **LogManagement** category contains Windows and Syslog events, performance data, and agent heartbeats.
 
-## Running a query
-Run a query by clicking the **Run** button or pressing **Shift+Enter**. Consider the following details which determine the code that will be run and the data that's returned:
+The schema tables appear on the **Tables** tab of the Log Analytics workspace. The tables contain columns, each with a data type shown by the icon next to the column name. For example, the **Event** table contains text columns like **Computer** and numerical columns like **EventCategory**.
 
-- Line breaks: A single break makes your query easier to read. Multiple line breaks split it into separate queries.
-- Cursor: Place your cursor somewhere inside the query to execute it. The current query is considered to be the code up until a blank line is found.
-- Time range - A time range of _last 24 hours_ is set by default. To use a different range, use the time-picker or add an explicit time range filter to your query.
+![Schema](media/get-started-portal/schema.png)
 
+## Write and run basic queries
 
-## Understand the schema
-The schema is a collection of tables visually grouped under a logical category. Several of the categories are from monitoring solutions. The _LogManagement_ category contains common data such as Windows and Syslog events, performance data, and agent heartbeats.
+Log Analytics opens with a new blank query in the **Query editor**.
 
-![Schema](media/get-started-portal/schema.png)
+![Log Analytics](media/get-started-portal/homepage.png)
 
-In each table, data is organized in columns with different data types as indicated by icons next to the column name. For example, the _Event_ table shown in the screenshot contains columns such as _Computer_ which is text, _EventCategory_ which is a number, and _TimeGenerated_ which is date/time.
+### Write a query
+Azure Monitor log queries use a version of the Kusto query language. Queries can begin with either a table name or a [search](/azure/kusto/query/searchoperator) command. 
 
-## Filter the results
-Start by getting everything in the _Event_ table.
+The following query retrieves all records from the **Event** table:
 
 ```Kusto
 Event
 ```
 
-Log Analytics automatically scopes results by:
-
-- Time range:  By default, queries are limited to the last 24 hours.
-- Number of results: Results are limited to maximum of 10,000 records.
+The pipe (|) character separates commands, so the output of the first command is the input of the next command. You can add any number of commands to a single query. The following query retrieves the records from the **Event** table, and then searches them for the term **error** in any property:
 
-This query is very general, and it returns too many results to be useful. You can filter the results either through the table elements, or by explicitly adding a filter to the query. Filtering results through the table elements applies to the existing result set, while a filter to the query itself will return a new filtered result set and could therefore produce more accurate results.
+```Kusto
+Event 
+| search ""error""
+```
 
-### Add a filter to the query
-There is an arrow to the left of each record. Click this arrow to open the details for a specific record.
+A single line break makes queries easier to read. More than one line break splits the query into separate queries.
 
-Hover above a column name for the ""+"" and ""-"" icons to display. To add a filter that will return only records with the same value, click the ""+"" sign. Click ""-"" to exclude records with this value and then click **Run** to run the query again.
+Another way to write the same query is:
 
-![Add filter to query](media/get-started-portal/add-filter.png)
+```Kusto
+search in (Event) ""error""
+```
 
-### Filter through the table elements
-Now let's focus on events with a severity of _Error_. This is specified in a column named _EventLevelName_. You'll need to scroll to the right to see this column.
+In the second example, the **search** command searches only records in the **Events** table for the term **error**.
 
-Click the Filter icon next to the column title, and in the pop-up window select values that _Starts with_ the text _error_:
+By default, Log Analytics limits queries to a time range of the past 24 hours. To set a different time range, you can add an explicit **TimeGenerated** filter to the query, or use the **Time range** control.
 
-![Filter](media/get-started-portal/filter.png)
+### Use the Time range control
+To use the **Time range** control, select it in the top bar, and then select a value from the dropdown list, or select **Custom** to create a custom time range.
 
+![Time picker](media/get-started-portal/time-picker.png)
 
-## Sort and group results
-The results are now narrowed down to include only error events from SQL Server, created in the last 24 hours. However, the results are not sorted in any way. To sort the results by a specific column, such as _timestamp_ for example, click the column title. One click sorts in ascending order while a second click will sort in descending.
+- Time range values are in UTC, which could be different than your local time zone.
+- If the query explicitly sets a filter for **TimeGenerated**, the time picker control shows **Set in query**, and is disabled to prevent a conflict.
+
+### Run a query
+To run a query, place your cursor somewhere inside the query, and select **Run** in the top bar or press **Shift**+**Enter**. The query runs until it finds a blank line.
+
+## Filter results
+Log Analytics limits results to a maximum of 10,000 records. A general query like `Event` returns too many results to be useful. You can filter query results either through restricting the table elements in the query, or by explicitly adding a filter to the results. Filtering through the table elements returns a new result set, while an explicit filter applies to the existing result set.
+
+### Filter by restricting table elements
+To filter `Event` query results to **Error** events by restricting table elements in the query:
+
+1. In the query results, select the dropdown arrow next to any record that has **Error** in the **EventLevelName** column. 
+   
+1. In the expanded details, hover over and select the **...** next to **EventLevelName**, and then select **Include ""Error""**. 
+   
+   ![Add filter to query](media/get-started-portal/add-filter.png)
+   
+1. Notice that the query in the **Query editor** has now changed to:
+   
+   ```Kusto
+   Event
+   | where EventLevelName == ""Error""
+   ```
+   
+1. Select **Run** to run the new query.
+
+### Filter by explicitly filtering results
+To filter the `Event` query results to **Error** events by filtering the query results:
+
+1. In the query results, select the **Filter** icon next to the column heading **EventLevelName**. 
+   
+1. In the first field of the pop-up window, select **Is equal to**, and in the next field, enter *error*. 
+   
+1. Select **Filter**.

-## Pin to dashboard
-To pin a diagram or table to one of your shared Azure dashboards, click the pin icon. Note that this icon has moved to the top of the Log Analytics window, different from the screenshot below.
+## Pin results to a dashboard
+To pin a results table or chart from Log Analytics to a shared Azure dashboard, select **Pin to dashboard** on the top bar. 
 
 ![Pin to dashboard](media/get-started-portal/pin-dashboard.png)
 
-Certain simplifications are applied to a chart when you pin it to a dashboard:
+In the **Pin to another dashboard** pane, select or create a shared dashboard to pin to, and select **Apply**. The table or chart appears on the selected Azure dashboard.
 
-- Table columns and rows: In order to pin a table to the dashboard, it must have four or fewer columns. Only the top seven rows are displayed.
-- Time restriction: Queries are automatically limited to the past 14 days.
-- Bin count restriction: If you display a chart that has a lot of discrete bins, less populated bins are automatically grouped into a single _others_ bin.
+![Chart pinned to dashboard](media/get-started-portal/pin-dashboard2.png)
 
-## Save queries
-Once you've created a useful query, you might want to save it or share with others. The **Save** icon is on the top bar.
+A table or chart that you pin to a shared dashboard has the following simplifications: 
 
-You can save either the entire query page, or a single query as a function. Functions are queries that can also be referenced by other queries. In order to save a query as a function, you must provide a function alias, which is the name used to call this query when referenced by other queries.
+- Data is limited to the past 14 days.
+- A table shows only up to four columns and the top seven rows.
+- Charts with many discrete categories automatically group less populated categories into a single **others** bin.
 
-![Save function](media/get-started-portal/save-function.png)
+## Save, load, or export queries
+Once you create a query, you can save or share the query or results with others. 
 
->[!NOTE]
->The following characters are supported - `a–z, A–Z, 0-9, -, _, ., <space>, (, ), |` in the **Name** field when saving or editing the saved query.
+### Save queries
+To save a query:
 
-Log Analytics queries are always saved to a selected workspace, and shared with other users of that workspace.
+1. Select **Save** on the top bar.
+   
+1. In the **Save** dialog, give the query a **Name**, using the characters a–z, A–Z, 0-9, space, hyphen, underscore, period, parenthesis, or pipe. 
+   
+1. Select whether to save the query as a **Query** or a **Function**. Functions are queries that other queries can reference. 
+   
+   To save a query as a function, provide a **Function Alias**, which is a short name for other queries to use to call this query.
+   
+1. Provide a **Category** for **Query explorer** to use for the query.
+   
+1. Select **Save**.
+   
+   ![Save function](media/get-started-portal/save-function.png)
 
-## Load queries
-The Query Explorer icon is at the top-right area. This lists all saved queries by category. It also enables you to mark specific queries as Favorites to quickly find them in the future. Double-click a saved query to add it to the current window.
+### Load queries
+To load a saved query, select **Query explorer** at upper right. The **Query explorer** pane opens, listing all queries by category. Expand the categories or enter a query name in the search bar, then select a query to load it into the **Query editor**. You can mark a query as a **Favorite** by selecting the star next to the query name.
 
 ![Query explorer](media/get-started-portal/query-explorer.png)
 
-## Export and share as link
-Log Analytics supports several exporting methods:
+### Export and share queries
+To export a query, select **Export** on the top bar, and then select **Export to CSV - all columns**, **Export to CSV - displayed columns**, or **Export to Power BI (M query)** from the dropdown list.
 
-- Excel: Save the results as a CSV file.
-- Power BI: Export the results to Power BI. See [Import Azure Monitor log data into Power BI](../../azure-monitor/platform/powerbi.md) for details.
-- Share a link: The query itself can be shared as a link which can then be sent and executed by other users that have access to the same workspace.
+To share a link to a query, select **Copy link** on the top bar, and then select **Copy link to query**, **Copy query text**, or **Copy query results** to copy to the clipboard. You can send the query link to others who have access to the same workspace.

-# Get started with Log Analytics in Azure Monitor
+# Tutorial: Get started with Log Analytics queries
 
-> [!NOTE]
-> You can work through this exercise in your own environment if you are collecting data from at least one virtual machine. If not then use our [Demo environment](https://portal.loganalytics.io/demo), which includes plenty of sample data.
+This tutorial shows you how to use Log Analytics to write, execute, and manage Azure Monitor log queries in the Azure portal. You can use Log Analytics queries to search for terms, identify trends, analyze patterns, and provide many other insights from your data. 
 
-In this tutorial you will learn how to use Log Analytics in the Azure portal to write Azure Monitor log queries. It will teach you how to:
+In this tutorial, you learn how to use Log Analytics to:
 
-- Use Log Analytics to write a simple query
-- Understand the schema of your data
-- Filter, sort, and group results
-- Apply a time range
-- Create charts
-- Save and load queries
-- Export and share queries
+> [!div class=""checklist""]
+> * Understand the log data schema
+> * Write and run simple queries, and modify the time range for queries
+> * Filter, sort, and group query results
+> * View, modify, and share visuals of query results
+> * Save, load, export, and copy queries and results

-For more details on log queries, see [Overview of log queries in Azure Monitor](log-query-overview.md).
+For more information about log queries, see [Overview of log queries in Azure Monitor](log-query-overview.md).<br/>
+For a detailed tutorial on writing log queries, see [Get started with log queries in Azure Monitor](get-started-queries.md).
 
-## Meet Log Analytics
-Log Analytics is a web tool used to write and execute Azure Monitor log queries. Open it by selecting **Logs** in the Azure Monitor menu. It starts with a new blank query.
+## Open Log Analytics
+To use Log Analytics, you need to be signed in to an Azure account. If you don't have an Azure account, [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
 
-![Home page](media/get-started-portal/homepage.png)
+To complete most of the steps in this tutorial, you can use [this demo environment](https://portal.loganalytics.io/demo), which includes plenty of sample data. With the demo environment, you won't be able to save queries or pin results to a dashboard.
 
-## Firewall requirements
-To use Log Analytics, your browser requires access to the following addresses. If your browser is accessing the Azure portal through a firewall, you must enable access to these addresses.
+You can also use your own environment, if you're using Azure Monitor to collect log data on at least one Azure resource. To open a Log Analytics workspace, in your Azure Monitor left navigation, select **Logs**.

-
-## Basic queries
-Queries can be used to search terms, identify trends, analyze patterns, and provide many other insights based on your data. Start with a basic query:
-
-```Kusto
-Event | search ""error""
-```
-
-This query searches the _Event_ table for records that contain the term _error_ in any property.
-
-Queries can start with either a table name or a [search](/azure/kusto/query/searchoperator) command. The above example starts with the table name _Event_, which retrieves all records from the Event table. The pipe (|) character separates commands, so the output of the first one serves as the input of the following command. You can add any number of commands to a single query.
-
-Another way to write that same query would be:
-
-```Kusto
-search in (Event) ""error""
-```
-
-In this example, **search** is scoped to the _Event_ table, and all records in that table are searched for the term _error_.
+## Understand the schema
+A *schema* is a collection of tables grouped under logical categories. The Demo schema has several categories from monitoring solutions. For example, the **LogManagement** category contains Windows and Syslog events, performance data, and agent heartbeats.
 
-## Running a query
-Run a query by clicking the **Run** button or pressing **Shift+Enter**. Consider the following details which determine the code that will be run and the data that's returned:
+The schema tables appear on the **Tables** tab of the Log Analytics workspace. The tables contain columns, each with a data type shown by the icon next to the column name. For example, the **Event** table contains text columns like **Computer** and numerical columns like **EventCategory**.
 
-- Line breaks: A single break makes your query easier to read. Multiple line breaks split it into separate queries.
-- Cursor: Place your cursor somewhere inside the query to execute it. The current query is considered to be the code up until a blank line is found.
-- Time range - A time range of _last 24 hours_ is set by default. To use a different range, use the time-picker or add an explicit time range filter to your query.
+![Schema](media/get-started-portal/schema.png)
 
+## Write and run basic queries
 
-## Understand the schema
-The schema is a collection of tables visually grouped under a logical category. Several of the categories are from monitoring solutions. The _LogManagement_ category contains common data such as Windows and Syslog events, performance data, and agent heartbeats.
+Log Analytics opens with a new blank query in the **Query editor**.
 
-![Schema](media/get-started-portal/schema.png)
+![Log Analytics](media/get-started-portal/homepage.png)
 
-In each table, data is organized in columns with different data types as indicated by icons next to the column name. For example, the _Event_ table shown in the screenshot contains columns such as _Computer_ which is text, _EventCategory_ which is a number, and _TimeGenerated_ which is date/time.
+### Write a query
+Azure Monitor log queries use a version of the Kusto query language. Queries can begin with either a table name or a [search](/azure/kusto/query/searchoperator) command. 
 
-## Filter the results
-Start by getting everything in the _Event_ table.
+The following query retrieves all records from the **Event** table:
 
 ```Kusto
 Event
 ```
 
-Log Analytics automatically scopes results by:
-
-- Time range:  By default, queries are limited to the last 24 hours.
-- Number of results: Results are limited to maximum of 10,000 records.
+The pipe (|) character separates commands, so the output of the first command is the input of the next command. You can add any number of commands to a single query. The following query retrieves the records from the **Event** table, and then searches them for the term **error** in any property:
 
-This query is very general, and it returns too many results to be useful. You can filter the results either through the table elements, or by explicitly adding a filter to the query. Filtering results through the table elements applies to the existing result set, while a filter to the query itself will return a new filtered result set and could therefore produce more accurate results.
+```Kusto
+Event 
+| search ""error""
+```
 
-### Add a filter to the query
-There is an arrow to the left of each record. Click this arrow to open the details for a specific record.
+A single line break makes queries easier to read. More than one line break splits the query into separate queries.
 
-Hover above a column name for the ""+"" and ""-"" icons to display. To add a filter that will return only records with the same value, click the ""+"" sign. Click ""-"" to exclude records with this value and then click **Run** to run the query again.
+Another way to write the same query is:
 
-![Add filter to query](media/get-started-portal/add-filter.png)
+```Kusto
+search in (Event) ""error""
+```
 
-### Filter through the table elements
-Now let's focus on events with a severity of _Error_. This is specified in a column named _EventLevelName_. You'll need to scroll to the right to see this column.
+In the second example, the **search** command searches only records in the **Events** table for the term **error**.
 
-Click the Filter icon next to the column title, and in the pop-up window select values that _Starts with_ the text _error_:
+By default, Log Analytics limits queries to a time range of the past 24 hours. To set a different time range, you can add an explicit **TimeGenerated** filter to the query, or use the **Time range** control.
 
-![Filter](media/get-started-portal/filter.png)
+### Use the Time range control
+To use the **Time range** control, select it in the top bar, and then select a value from the dropdown list, or select **Custom** to create a custom time range.
 
+![Time picker](media/get-started-portal/time-picker.png)
 
-## Sort and group results
-The results are now narrowed down to include only error events from SQL Server, created in the last 24 hours. However, the results are not sorted in any way. To sort the results by a specific column, such as _timestamp_ for example, click the column title. One click sorts in ascending order while a second click will sort in descending.

+# Review security audit events in Azure AD Domain Services using Azure Monitor Workbooks
+
+To help you understand the state of your Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS) managed domain, you can enable security audit events. These security audit events can then be reviewed using Azure Monitor Workbooks that combine text, analytics queries, and parameters into rich interactive reports. Azure AD DS includes workbook templates for security overview and account activity that let you dig into audit events and manage your environment.
+
+This article shows you how to use Azure Monitor Workbooks to review security audit events in Azure AD DS.
+
+## Before you begin
+
+To complete this article, you need the following resources and privileges:
+
+* An active Azure subscription.
+    * If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create an account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
+* An Azure Active Directory tenant associated with your subscription, either synchronized with an on-premises directory or a cloud-only directory.
+    * If needed, [create an Azure Active Directory tenant][create-azure-ad-tenant] or [associate an Azure subscription with your account][associate-azure-ad-tenant].
+* An Azure Active Directory Domain Services managed domain enabled and configured in your Azure AD tenant.
+    * If needed, complete the tutorial to [create and configure an Azure Active Directory Domain Services instance][create-azure-ad-ds-instance].
+* Security audit events enabled for your Azure Active Directory Domain Services managed domain that stream data to a Log Analytics workspace.
+    * If needed, [enable security audits for Azure Active Directory Domain Services][enable-security-audits].
+
+## Azure Monitor Workbooks overview
+
+When security audit events are turned on in Azure AD DS, it can be hard to analyze and identify issues in the managed domain. Azure Monitor lets you aggregate these security audit events and query the data. With Azure Monitor Workbooks, you can visualize this data to make it quicker and easier to identify issues.
+
+Workbook templates are curated reports that are designed for flexible reuse by multiple users and teams. When you open a workbook template, the data from your Azure Monitor environment is loaded. You can use templates without an impact on other users in your organization, and can save your own workbooks based on the template.
+
+Azure AD DS includes the following two workbook templates:
+
+* Security overview report
+* Account activity report
+
+For more information about how to edit and manage workbooks, see [Azure Monitor Workbooks overview](../azure-monitor/platform/workbooks-overview.md).
+
+## Use the security overview report workbook
+
+To help you better understand usage and identify potential security threats, the security overview report summarizes sign-in data and identifies accounts you might want to check on. You can view events in a particular date range, and drill down into specific sign-in events, such as bad password attempts or where the account was disabled.
+
+To access the workbook template for the security overview report, complete the following steps:
+
+1. Search for and select **Azure Active Directory Domain Services** in the Azure portal.
+1. Select your managed domain, such as *aaddscontoso.com*
+1. From the menu on the left-hand side, choose **Monitoring > Workbooks**
+
+    ![Select the Workbooks menu option in the Azure portal](./media/use-azure-monitor-workbooks/select-workbooks-in-azure-portal.png)
+
+1. Choose the **Security Overview Report**.
+1. From the drop-down menus at the top of the workbook, select your Azure subscription and then Azure Monitor workspace. Choose a **Time range**, such as *Last 7 days*.
+
+    ![Select the Workbooks menu option in the Azure portal](./media/use-azure-monitor-workbooks/select-query-filters.png)
+
+    The **Tile view** and **Chart view** options can also be changed to analyze and visualize the data as desired
+
+1. To drill down into a specific event type, select the one of the **Sign-in result** cards such as *Account Locked Out*, as shown in the following example:
+
+    ![Example Security Overview Report data visualized in Azure Monitor Workbooks](./media/use-azure-monitor-workbooks/example-security-overview-report.png)
+
+1. The lower part of the security overview report below the chart then breaks down the activity type selected. You can filter by usernames involved on the right-hand side, as shown in the following example report:
+
+    [![](./media/use-azure-monitor-workbooks/account-lockout-details-cropped.png ""Details of account lockouts in Azure Monitor Workbooks"")](./media/use-azure-monitor-workbooks/account-lockout-details.png#lightbox)
+
+## Use the account activity report workbook
+
+To help you troubleshoot issues for a specific user account, the account activity report breaks down detailed audit event log information. You can review when a bad username or password was provided during sign-in, and the source of the sign-in attempt.
+
+To access the workbook template for the account activity report, complete the following steps:
+
+1. Search for and select **Azure Active Directory Domain Services** in the Azure portal.
+1. Select your managed domain, such as *aaddscontoso.com*
+1. From the menu on the left-hand side, choose **Monitoring > Workbooks**
+1. Choose the **Account Activity Report**.
+1. From the drop-down menus at the top of the workbook, select your Azure subscription and then Azure Monitor workspace. Choose a **Time range**, such as *Last 30 days*, then how you want the **Tile view** to represent the data. You can filter by **Account username**, such as *felix*, as shown in the following example report:
+
+    [![](./media/use-azure-monitor-workbooks/account-activity-report-cropped.png ""Account activity report in Azure Monitor Workbooks"")](./media/use-azure-monitor-workbooks/account-activity-report.png#lightbox)
+
+    The area below the chart shows individual sign-in events along with information such as the activity result and source workstation. This information can help determine repeated sources of sign-in events that may cause account lockouts or indicate a potential attack.
+
+As with the security overview report, you can drill down into the different tiles at the top of the report to visualize and analyze the data as needed.
+
+## Save and edit workbooks
+
+The two template workbooks provided by Azure AD DS are a good place to start with your own data analysis. If you need to get more granular in the data queries and investigations, you can save your own workbooks and edit the queries.
+
+1. To save a copy of one of the workbook templates, select **Edit > Save as > Shared reports**, then provide a name and save it.
+1. From your own copy of the template, select **Edit** to enter the edit mode. You can choose the blue **Edit** button next to any part of the report and change it.
+
+All of the charts and tables in Azure Monitor Workbooks are generated using Kusto queries. For more information on creating your own queries, see [Azure Monitor log queries][azure-monitor-queries] and [Kusto queries tutorial][kusto-queries].
+
+## Next steps
+
+If you need to adjust password and lockout policies, see [Password and account lockout policies on managed domains][password-policy].
+
+For problems with users, learn how to troubleshoot [account sign-in problems][troubleshoot-sign-in] or [account lockout problems][troubleshoot-account-lockout].

+
+OpenCensus Python does not automatically track and send `exception` telemetry. They are sent through the `AzureLogHandler` by using exceptions through the Python logging library. You can add custom properties just like with normal logging.
+
+    ```python
+    import logging
+    
+    from opencensus.ext.azure.log_exporter import AzureLogHandler
+    
+    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
+    # TODO: replace the all-zero GUID with your instrumentation key.
+    logger.addHandler(AzureLogHandler(
+        connection_string='InstrumentationKey=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000')
+    )
+
+    properties = {'custom_dimensions': {'key_1': 'value_1', 'key_2': 'value_2'}}
 
     # Use properties in exception logs
     try:
         result = 1 / 0  # generate a ZeroDivisionError
     except Exception:
-    logger.exception('Captured an exception.', extra=properties)
+        logger.exception('Captured an exception.', extra=properties)
     ```
+Since you must log exceptions explicitly, it is up to the user in how they want to log unhandled exceptions. OpenCensus does not place restrictions in how a user wants to do this, as long as they explicitly log an exception telemetry.
+
 #### Sampling
 
 For information on sampling in OpenCensus, take a look at [sampling in OpenCensus](sampling.md#configuring-fixed-rate-sampling-for-opencensus-python-applications)."

+# Monitoring Azure virtual machines with Azure Monitor
+This article describes how to use Azure Monitor to collect and analyze monitoring data from Azure virtual machines to maintain their health. Virtual machines can be monitored for availability and performance with Azure Monitor like any [other Azure resource](monitor-azure-resource.md), but they're unique from other resources since you also need to monitor the guest operating and system and the workloads that run in it. 
+
+> [!NOTE]
+> This article provides a complete overview of the concepts and options for monitoring virtual machines in Azure Monitor. To start monitoring your virtual machines quickly without focusing on the underlying concepts, see [Quickstart: Monitor an Azure virtual machine with Azure Monitor](../learn/quick-monitor-azure-vm.md).
+
+
+## Differences from other Azure resources
+[Monitoring Azure resources with Azure Monitor](monitor-azure-resource.md) describes the monitoring data generated by Azure resources and how you can use the features of Azure Monitor to analyze and alert on this data. You can collect and act on the same monitoring data from Azure virtual machines with the following differences:
+
+- [Platform metrics](../platform/data-platform-metrics.md) are collected automatically for virtual machines but only for the [virtual machine host](#monitoring-data). You need an agent to collect performance data from the guest operating system. 
+- Virtual machines don't generate [resource logs](../platform/platform-logs-overview.md) which provide insight into operations that were performed within an Azure resource. You use an agent to collect log data from the guest operating system.
+- You can create [diagnostic settings](../platform/diagnostic-settings.md) for a virtual machine to send platform metrics to other destinations such as storage and event hubs, but you can't configure these diagnostic settings in the Azure portal. 
+
+## Monitoring data
+Virtual machines in Azure in Azure generate [logs](../platform/data-platform-logs.md) and [metrics](../platform/data-platform-metrics.md) shown the following diagram.
+
+![Overview](media/monitor-vm-azure/logs-metrics.png)
+
+
+### Virtual machine host
+Virtual machines in Azure generate the following data for the virtual machine host the same as other Azure resources as described in [Monitoring data](monitor-azure-resource.md#monitoring-data).
+
+- [Platform metrics](../platform/data-platform-metrics.md) - Numerical values that are automatically collected at regular intervals and describe some aspect of a resource at a particular time. Platform metrics are collected for the virtual machine host, but you require the diagnostics extension to collect metrics for the guest operating system.
+- [Activity log](../platform/platform-logs-overview.md) - Provides insight into the operations on each Azure resource in the subscription from the outside (the management plane). For a virtual machine, this includes such information as when it was started and any configuration changes.
+
+
+### Guest operating system
+To collect data from the guest operating system of a virtual machine, you require an agent, which runs locally on each virtual machine and sends data to Azure Monitor. Multiple agents are available for Azure Monitor with each collecting different data and writing data to different locations. Get a detailed comparison of the different agents at [Overview of the Azure Monitor agents](../platform/agents-overview.md). 
+
+- [Log Analytics agent](../platform/agents-overview.md#log-analytics-agent) - Available for virtual machines in Azure, other cloud environments, and on-premises. Collects data to Azure Monitor Logs. Supports Azure Monitor for VMs and monitoring solutions. This is the same agent used for System Center Operations Manager.
+- [Dependency agent](../platform/agents-overview.md#dependency-agent) - Collects data about the processes running on the virtual machine and their dependencies. Relies on the Log Analytics agent to transmit data into Azure and supports Azure Monitor for VMs, Service Map, and Wire Data 2.0 solutions.
+- [Azure Diagnostic extension](../platform/agents-overview.md#azure-diagnostics-extension) - Available for Azure Monitor virtual machines only. Can collect data to multiple locations but primarily used to collect guest performance data into Azure Monitor Metrics for Windows virtual machines.
+- [Telegraf agent](../platform/collect-custom-metrics-linux-telegraf.md) - Collect performance data from Linux VMs into Azure Monitor Metrics.
+
+
+## Configuration requirements
+To enable all features of Azure Monitor for monitoring a virtual machine, you need to collect monitoring data from the virtual machine host and guest operating system to both [Azure Monitor Metrics](../platform/data-platform-logs.md) and [Azure Monitor Logs](../platform/data-platform-logs.md). The following table lists the configuration that must be performed to enable this collection. You may choose to not perform all of these steps depending on your particular requirements.
+
+| Configuration step | Actions completed | Features enabled |
+|:---|:---|:---|
+| No configuration | - Host platform metrics collected to Metrics.<br>- Activity log collected. | - Metrics explorer for host.<br>- Metrics alerts for host.<br>- Activity log alerts. |
+| [Enable Azure Monitor for VMs](#enable-azure-monitor-for-vms) | - Log Analytics agent installed.<br>- Dependency agent installed.<br>- Guest performance data collected to Logs.<br>- Process and dependency details collected to Logs. | - Performance charts and workbooks for guest performance data.<br>- Log queries for guest performance data.<br>- Log alerts for guest performance data.<br>- Dependency map. |
+| [Install the diagnostics extension and telegraf agent](#enable-diagnostics-extension-and-telegraf-agent) | - Guest performance data collected to Metrics. | - Metrics explorer for guest.<br>- Metrics alerts for guest.  |
+| [Configure Log Analytics workspace](#configure-log-analytics-workspace) | - Events collected from guest. | - Log queries for guest events.<br>- Log alerts for guest events. |
+| [Create diagnostic setting for virtual machine](#collect-platform-metrics-and-activity-log) | - Platform metrics collected to Logs.<br>- Activity log collected to Logs. | - Loq queries for host metrics.<br>- Log alerts for host metrics.<br>- Log queries for Activity log.
+
+Each of these configuration steps is described in the following sections.
+
+### Enable Azure Monitor for VMs
+[Azure Monitor for VMs](vminsights-overview.md) is an [insight](insights-overview.md) in Azure Monitor that is the primary tool for monitoring virtual machines in Azure Monitor. It provides the following additional value over standard Azure Monitor features.
+
+- Simplified onboarding of Log Analytics agent and Dependency agent to enable monitoring of a virtual machine guest operating system and workloads. 
+- Pre-defined trending performance charts and workbooks that allow you to analyze core performance metrics from the virtual machine's guest operating system.
+- Dependency map that displays processes running on each virtual machine and the interconnected components with other machines and external sources.
+
+![Azure Monitor for VMs](media/monitor-vm-azure/vminsights-01.png)
+
+![Azure Monitor for VMs](media/monitor-vm-azure/vminsights-02.png)
+
+
+Enable Azure Monitor for VMs from the **Insights** option in the virtual machine menu of the Azure portal. See [Enable Azure Monitor for VMs overview](vminsights-enable-overview.md) for details and other configuration methods.
+
+![Enable Azure Monitor for VMs](media/monitor-vm-azure/enable-vminsights.png)
+
+### Configure Log Analytics workspace
+The Log Analytics agent used by Azure Monitor for VMs sends data to a [Log Analytics workspace](../platform/data-platform-logs.md#how-is-data-in-azure-monitor-logs-structured). You can enable the collection of additional performance data, events, and other monitoring data from the agent by configuring the Log Analytics workspace. It only needs to be configured once, since any agent connecting to the workspace will automatically download the configuration and immediately start collecting the defined data. 
+
+You can access the configuration for the workspace directly from Azure Monitor for VMs by selecting **Workspace configuration** from the **Get Started**. Click on the workspace name to open its menu.
+
+![Workspace configuration](media/monitor-vm-azure/workspace-configuration.png)
+
+Select **Advanced Settings** from the workspace menu and then **Data** to configure data sources. For Windows agents, select **Windows Event Logs** and add common event logs such as *System* and *Application*. For Linux agents, select **Syslog** and add common facilities such as *kern* and *daemon*. See [Agent data sources in Azure Monitor](../platform/agent-data-sources.md) for a list of the data sources available and details on configuring them. 
+
+![Configure events](media/monitor-vm-azure/configure-events.png)
+
+
+> [!NOTE]
+> You can configure performance counters to be collected from the workspace configuration, but this may be redundant with the performance counters collected by Azure Monitor for VMs. Azure Monitor for VMs collects the most common set of counters at a frequency of once per minute. Only configure performance counters to be collected by the workspace if you want to collect counters not already collected by Azure Monitor for VMs or if you have existing queries using performance data.
+
+
+### Enable diagnostics extension and Telegraf agent
+Azure Monitor for VMs is based on the Log Analytics agent that collects data into a Log Analytics workspace. This supports [multiple features of Azure Monitor](../platform/data-platform-logs.md#what-can-you-do-with-azure-monitor-logs) such as [log queries](../log-query/log-query-overview.md), [log alerts](../platform/alerts-log.md), and [workbooks](../platform/workbooks-overview.md). The [diagnostics extension](../platform/diagnostics-extension-overview.md) collects performance data from the guest operating system of Windows virtual machines to Azure Storage and optionally sends performance data to [Azure Monitor Metrics](../platform/data-platform-metrics.md). For Linux virtual machines, the [Telegraf agent](../platform/collect-custom-metrics-linux-telegraf.md) is required to send data to Azure Metrics.  This enables other features of Azure Monitor such as [metrics explorer](../platform/metrics-getting-started.md) and [metrics alerts](../platform/alerts-metric.md). You can also configure the diagnostics extension to send events and performance data outside of Azure Monitor using Azure Event Hubs.
+
+Install the diagnostics extension for a single Windows virtual machine in the Azure portal from the **Diagnostics setting** option in the VM menu. Select the option to enable **Azure Monitor** in the **Sinks** tab. To enable the extension from a template or command line for multiple virtual machines, see [Installation and configuration](../platform/diagnostics-extension-overview.md#installation-and-configuration). Unlike the Log Analytics agent, the data to collect is defined in the configuration for the extension on each virtual machine.
+
+![Diagnostic setting](media/monitor-vm-azure/diagnostic-setting.png)
+
+See [Install and configure Telegraf](../platform/collect-custom-metrics-linux-telegraf.md#install-and-configure-telegraf) for details on configuring the Telegraf agents on Linux virtual machines. The **Diagnostic setting** menu option is available for Linux, but it will only allow you to send data to Azure storage.
+
+### Collect platform metrics and Activity log
+You can view the platform metrics and Activity log collected for each virtual machine host in the Azure portal. Collect this data into the same Log Analytics workspace as Azure Monitor for VMs to analyze it with the other monitoring data collected for the virtual machine. This collection is configured with a [diagnostic setting](../platform/diagnostic-settings.md). Collect the Activity log with a [diagnostic setting for the subscription](../platform/diagnostic-settings.md#create-diagnostic-settings-in-azure-portal).
+
+Collect platform metrics with a diagnostic setting for the virtual machine. Unlike other Azure resources, you cannot create a diagnostic setting for a virtual machine in the Azure portal but must use [another method](../platform/diagnostic-settings.md#create-diagnostic-settings-using-powershell). The following examples show how to collect metrics for a virtual machine using both PowerShell and CLI.
+
+```powershell
+Set-AzDiagnosticSetting -Name vm-diagnostics -ResourceId ""/subscriptions/monitor diagnostic-settings create \
+xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/my-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/my-vm"" -Enabled $true -MetricCategory AllMetrics -workspaceId ""/subscriptions/monitor diagnostic-settings create \
+xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourcegroups/my-resource-group/providers/microsoft.operationalinsights/workspaces/my-workspace""
+```
+
+```CLI
+az monitor diagnostic-settings create \
+--name VM-Diagnostics 
+--resource /subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/my-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/my-vm \
+--metrics '[{""category"": ""AllMetrics"",""enabled"": true}]' \
+--workspace /subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourcegroups/my-resource-group/providers/microsoft.operationalinsights/workspaces/my-workspace
+
+```
+
+## Monitoring in the Azure portal 
+Once you configure collection of monitoring data for a virtual machine, you have multiple options for accessing it in the Azure portal:
+
+- Use the **Azure Monitor** menu to access data from all monitored resources. 
+- Use Azure Monitor for VMs for monitoring sets of virtual machines at scale.
+- Analyze data for a single virtual machine from its menu in the Azure portal. The table below lists different options for monitoring the virtual machines menu.
+
+![Monitoring in the Azure portal](media/monitor-vm-azure/monitor-menu.png)
+
+| Menu option | Description |
+|:---|:---|
+| Overview | Displays [platform metrics](../platform/data-platform-metrics.md) for the virtual machine host. Click on a graph to work with this data in [metrics explorer](../platform/metrics-getting-started.md). |
+| Activity log | [Activity log](../platform/activity-log-view.md) entries filtered for the current virtual machine. |
+| Insights | Opens [Azure Monitor for VMs](../insights/vminsights-overview.md) with the map for the current virtual machine selected. |
+| Alerts | Views [alerts](../platform/alerts-overview.md) for the current virtual machine.  |
+| Metrics | Open [metrics explorer](../platform/metrics-getting-started.md) with the scope set to the current virtual machine. |
+| Diagnostic settings | Enable and configure [diagnostics extension](../platform/diagnostics-extension-overview.md) for the current virtual machine. |
+| Advisor recommendations | Recommendations for the current virtual machine from [Azure Advisor](/azure/advisor/). |
+| Logs | Open [Log Analytics](../log-query/log-query-overview.md#what-is-log-analytics) with the [scope](../log-query/scope.md) set to the current virtual machine. |
+| Connection monitor | Open [Network Watcher Connection Monitor](../../network-watcher/connection-monitor-preview.md) to monitor connections between the current virtual machine and other virtual machines. |
+
+
+## Analyzing metric data
+You can analyze metrics for virtual machines using metrics explorer by opening **Metrics** from the virtual machine's menu. See [Getting started with Azure Metrics Explorer](../platform/metrics-getting-started.md) for details on using this tool. 
+
+There are two namespaces used by virtual machines for metrics:
+
+| Namespace | Description |
+|:---|:---|
+| Virtual Machine Host | Host metrics automatically collected for all Azure virtual machines. Detailed list of metrics at [Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines](../platform/metrics-supported.md#microsoftcomputevirtualmachines). |
+| Virtual Machine Guest | Guest operating system metrics collected from virtual machines with diagnostics extension installed and configured to send to Azure Monitor sink. |
+
+![Metrics](media/monitor-vm-azure/metrics.png)
+
+## Analyzing log data
+Azure virtual machines will collect the following data to Azure Monitor Logs. 
+
+Azure Monitor for VMs enables the collection of a predetermined set of performance counters that are written to the *InsightsMetrics* table. This is the same table used by [Azure Monitor for Containers](container-insights-overview.md). 
+
+| Data source | Requirements | Tables |
+|:---|:---|:---|
+| Azure Monitor for VMs | Enable on each virtual machine. | InsightsMetrics<br>VMBoundPort<br>VMComputer<br>VMConnection<br>VMProcess<br>See [How to query logs from Azure Monitor for VMs](vminsights-log-search.md#sample-log-searches) for details. |
+| Activity log | Diagnostic setting for the subscription. | AzureActivity |
+| Host metrics | Diagnostic setting for the virtual machine. | AzureMetrics |
+| Data sources from the guest operating system | Enable Log Analytics agent and configure data sources. | See documentation for each data source. |
+
+
+> [!NOTE]
+> Performance data collected by the Log Analytics agent writes to the *Perf* table while Azure Monitor for VMs will collect it to the *InsightsMetrics* table. This is the same data, but the tables have a different structure. If you have existing queries based on *Perf*, the will need to be rewritten to use *InsightsMetrics*.
+
+
+## Alerts
+[Alerts](../platform/alerts-overview.md) in Azure Monitor proactively notify you when important conditions are found in your monitoring data and potentially launch an action such as starting a Logic App or calling a webhook. Alert rules define the logic used to determine when an alert should be created. Azure Monitor collects the data used by alert rules, but you need to create rules to define alerting conditions in your Azure subscription.
+
+The following sections describe the types of alert rules and recommendations on when you should use each. This recommendation is based on the functionality and cost of the alert rule type. For details pricing of alerts, see [Azure Monitor pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/).
+
+
+### Activity log alert rules
+[Activity log alert rules](../platform/alerts-activity-log.md) fire when an entry matching particular criteria is created in the activity log. They have no cost so they should be your first choice if the logic you require is in the activity log. 
+
+The target resource for activity log alerts can be a specific virtual machine, all virtual machines in a resource group, or all virtual machines in a subscription.
+
+For example, create an alert if a critical virtual machine is stopped by selecting the *Power Off Virtual Machine* for the signal name.
+
+![Activity log alert](media/monitor-vm-azure/activity-log-alert.png)
+
+
+### Metric alert rules
+[Metric alert rules](../platform/alerts-metric.md) fire when a metric value exceeds a threshold. You can define a specific threshold value or allow Azure Monitor to dynamically determine a threshold based on historical data.  Use metric alerts whenever possible with metric data since they cost less and are more responsive than log alert rules. They are also stateful meaning they will resolve themselves when the metric drops below the threshold.
+
+The target resource for activity log alerts can be a specific virtual machine or all virtual machines in a resource group.
+
+For example, to create an alert when the processor of a virtual machine exceeds a particular value, create a metric alert rule using *Percentage CPU* as the signal type. Set either a specific threshold value or allow Azure Monitor to set a dynamic threshold. 
+
+![Metric alert](media/monitor-vm-azure/metric-alert.png)
+
+### Log alerts
+[Log alert rules](../platform/alerts-log.md) fire when the results of a scheduled log query match certain criteria. Log query alerts are the most expensive and least responsive of the alert rules, but they have access to the most diverse data and can perform complex logic that can't be performed by the other alert rules. 
+
+The target resource for a log query is a Log Analytics workspace. Filter for specific computers in the query.
+
+For example, to create an alert that checks if any virtual machines in a particular resource group are offline, use the following query which returns a record for each computer that's missed a heartbeat in the last ten minutes. Use a threshold of 1 which fires if at least one computer has a missed heartbeat.
+
+```kusto
+Heartbeat
+| where TimeGenerated < ago(10m)
+| where ResourceGroup == ""my-resource-group""
+| summarize max(TimeGenerated) by Computer
+```
+
+![Log alert](media/monitor-vm-azure/log-alert-01.png)
+
+To create an alert if an excessive number of failed logons have occurred on any Windows virtual machines in the subscription, use the following query which returns a record for each failed logon event in the past hour. Use a threshold set to the number of failed logons that you'll allow. 
+
+```kusto
+Event
+| where TimeGenerated < ago(1hr)
+| where EventID == 4625
+```
+
+![Log alert](media/monitor-vm-azure/log-alert-02.png)
+
+
+## System Center Operations Manager
+System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) provides granular monitoring of workloads on virtual machines. See the [Cloud Monitoring Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/monitor/) for a comparison of monitoring platforms and different strategies for implementation.
+
+If you have an existing SCOM environment that you intend to keep using, you can integrate it with Azure Monitor to provide additional functionality. The Log Analytics agent used by Azure Monitor is the same one used for SCOM so that you have monitored virtual machines send data to both. You still need to add the agent to Azure Monitor for VMs and configure the workspace to collect additional data as specified above, but the virtual machines can continue to run their existing management packs in a SCOM environment without modification.
+
+Features of Azure Monitor that augment an existing SCOM features include the following:
+
+- Use Log Analytics to interactively analyze your log and performance data.
+- Use log alerts to define alerting conditions across multiple virtual machines and using long term trends that aren't possible using alerts in SCOM.   
+
+See [Connect Operations Manager to Azure Monitor](../platform/om-agents.md) for details on connecting your existing SCOM management group to your Log Analytics workspace.

+# Quickstart: Monitor an Azure virtual machine with Azure Monitor
+[Azure Monitor](../overview.md) starts collecting data from Azure virtual machines the moment that they're created. In this quickstart, you'll take a brief walkthrough the data that's automatically collected for an Azure VM and how to view it in the Azure portal. You'll then enable [Azure Monitor for VMs](../insights/vminsights-overview.md) for your VM which will enable agents on the VM to collect and analyze data from the guest operating system including processes and their dependencies.
+
+This quickstart assumes you have an existing Azure virtual machine. If not you can create a [Windows VM](../../virtual-machines/windows/quick-create-portal.md) or create a [Linux VM](../../virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-cli.md) following our VM quickstarts.
+
+For more detailed descriptions of monitoring data collected from Azure resources  see [Monitoring Azure virtual machines with Azure Monitor](../insights/monitor-vm-azure.md).
+
+
+## Complete the Monitor an Azure resource quickstart.
+Complete [Monitor an Azure resource with Azure Monitor](quick-monitor-azure-resource.md) to view the overview page, activity log, and metrics for a VM in your subscription. Azure VMs collect the same monitoring data as any other Azure resource, but this is only for the host VM. The rest of this quickstart will focus on monitoring the guest operating system and its workloads.
+
+
+## Enable Azure Monitor for VMs
+While metrics and activity logs will be collected for the host VM, you need an agent and some configuration to collect and analyze monitoring data from the guest operating system and its workloads. Azure Monitor for VMs installs these agents and provides additional powerful features for monitoring your virtual machines.
+
+1. Go to the menu for your virtual machine.
+2. Either click **Go to Insights** from the tile in the **Overview** page, or click on **Insights** from the **Monitoring** menu.
+
+    ![Overview page](media/quick-monitor-azure-vm/overview-insights.png)
+
+3. If Azure Monitor for VMs has not yet been enabled for the virtual machine, click **Enable**. 
+
+    ![Enable insights](media/quick-monitor-azure-vm/enable-insights.png)
+
+4. If the virtual machine isn't already attached to a Log Analytics workspace, you will be prompted to select an existing workspace or create a new one. Select the default which is a workspace with a unique name in the same region as your virtual machine.
+
+    ![Select workspace](media/quick-monitor-azure-vm/select-workspace.png)
+
+5. Onboarding will take a few minutes as extensions are enabled and agents are installed on your virtual machine. When it's complete, you get a message that insights have been successfully deployed. Click **Azure Monitor** to open Azure Monitor for VMs.
+
+    ![Open Azure Monitor](media/quick-monitor-azure-vm/azure-monitor.png)
+
+6. You'll see your VM with any other VMs in your subscription that are onboarded. Select the **Not monitored** tab if you want to view virtual machines in your subscription that aren't onboarded.
+
+    ![Get started](media/quick-monitor-azure-vm/get-started.png)
+
+
+## Configure workspace
+When you create a new Log Analytics workspace, it needs to be configured to collect logs. This configuration only needs to be performed once since configuration is sent to any virtual machines that connect to it.
+
+1. Select **Workspace configuration** and then select your workspace.
+
+2. Select **Advanced settings**
+
+    ![Log Analytics Advance Settings](media/quick-collect-azurevm/log-analytics-advanced-settings-azure-portal.png)
+
+### Data collection from Windows VM
+
+
+2. Select **Data**, and then select **Windows Event Logs**.
+
+3. Add an event log by typing in the name of the log.  Type **System** and then select the plus sign **+**.
+
+4. In the table, check the severities **Error** and **Warning**.
+
+5. Select **Save** at the top of the page to save the configuration.
+
+### Data collection from Linux VM
+
+1. Select **Syslog**.  
+
+2. Add an event log by typing in the name of the log.  Type **Syslog** and then select the plus sign **+**.  
+
+3. In the table, deselect the severities **Info**, **Notice** and **Debug**. 
+
+4. Select **Save** at the top of the page to save the configuration.
+
+## View data collected
+
+7. Click on your virtual machine and then select the **Performance** tab. This shows a select group of performance counters collected from the guest operating system of your VM. Scroll down to view more counters, and move the mouse over a graph to view average and percentiles at different times.
+
+    ![Performance](media/quick-monitor-azure-vm/performance.png)
+
+9. Select **Map** to open the maps feature which shows the processes running on the virtual machine and their dependencies. Select **Properties** to open the property pane if it isn't already open.
+
+    ![Map](media/quick-monitor-azure-vm/map.png)
+
+11. Expand the processes for your virtual machine. Select one of the processes to view its details and to highlight its dependencies.
+
+    ![Processes](media/quick-monitor-azure-vm/processes.png)
+
+12. Select your virtual machine again and then select **Log Events**. 
+
+    ![Log events](media/quick-monitor-azure-vm/log-events.png)
+
+13. You see a list of tables that are stored in the Log Analytics workspace for the virtual machine. This list will be different depending whether you're using a Windows or Linux virtual machine. Click the **Event** table. This includes all events from the Windows event log. Log Analytics opens with a simple query to retrieve event log entries.
+
+    ![Log analytics](media/quick-monitor-azure-vm/log-analytics.png)
+
+## Next steps
+In this quickstart, you enabled Azure Monitor for VMs for a virtual machine and configured the Log Analytics workspace to collect events for the guest operating system. To learn how to view and analyze the data, continue to the tutorial.

 ## Monitoring at scale using metric alerts in Azure Monitor
 
-So far, you have seen how a single metric alert could be used to monitor one or many metric time-series related to a single Azure resource. Many times, you might want the same alert rule applied to many resources. Azure Monitor also supports monitoring multiple resources (of the same type) with one metric alert rule, for resources that exist in the same Azure region. This feature is currently supported only in Azure public cloud and only for virtual machines, SQL server databases, SQL server elastic pools and Data box edge devices. Also, this feature is only available for platform metrics, and isn't supported for custom metrics.

+# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Datadog
+
+In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Datadog with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Datadog with Azure AD, you can:
+
+* Control in Azure AD who has access to Datadog.
+* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Datadog with their Azure AD accounts.
+* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.
+
+To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on).
+
+## Prerequisites
+
+To get started, you need the following items:
+
+* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
+* Datadog single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
+
+## Scenario description
+
+In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.
+
+* Datadog supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO
+* Once you configure Datadog you can enforce Session Control, which protect exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real-time. Session Control extend from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad)
+
+
+## Adding Datadog from the gallery
+
+To configure the integration of Datadog into Azure AD, you need to add Datadog from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.
+
+1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
+1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
+1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
+1. To add new application, select **New application**.
+1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Datadog** in the search box.
+1. Select **Datadog** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.
+
+
+## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for Datadog
+
+Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Datadog using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Datadog.
+
+To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Datadog, complete the following building blocks:
+
+1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
+    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
+    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
+1. **[Configure Datadog SSO](#configure-datadog-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
+    1. **[Create Datadog test user](#create-datadog-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Datadog that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
+1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.
+
+## Configure Azure AD SSO
+
+Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.
+
+1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Datadog** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
+1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
+1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.
+
+   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)
+
+1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, the user does not have to perform any step as the app is already pre-integrated with Azure.
+
+1. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:
+
+    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
+    `https://app.datadoghq.com/account/login/id/<CUSTOM_IDENTIFIER>`
+
+    > [!NOTE]
+	> The value is not real. Update the value with the actual Sign-on URL. Contact [Datadog Client support team](mailto:xuefwu@microsoft.com) to get the value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.
+
+1. Click **Save**.
+
+1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.
+
+	![The Certificate download link](common/metadataxml.png)
+
+1. On the **Set up Datadog** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.
+
+	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)
+
+### Create an Azure AD test user
+
+In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.
+
+1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
+1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
+1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
+   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
+   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
+   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
+   1. Click **Create**.
+
+### Assign the Azure AD test user
+
+In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Datadog.
+
+1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
+1. In the applications list, select **Datadog**.
+1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
+
+   ![The ""Users and groups"" link](common/users-groups-blade.png)
+
+1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
+
+	![The Add User link](common/add-assign-user.png)
+
+1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
+1. If you're expecting any role value in the SAML assertion, in the **Select Role** dialog, select the appropriate role for the user from the list and then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
+1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.
+
+
+## Configure Datadog SSO

+
+### Create Datadog test user
+
+In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in Datadog. Work with [Datadog support team](mailto:xuefwu@microsoft.com) to add the users in the Datadog platform.
+
+## Test SSO 
+
+In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.
+
+When you click the Datadog tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Datadog for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).

+# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Planview Enterprise One
+
+In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Planview Enterprise One with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Planview Enterprise One with Azure AD, you can:
+
+* Control in Azure AD who has access to Planview Enterprise One.
+* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Planview Enterprise One with their Azure AD accounts.
+* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.
+
+To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on).
+
+## Prerequisites
+
+To get started, you need the following items:
+
+* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
+* Planview Enterprise One single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
+
+## Scenario description
+
+In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.
+
+* Planview Enterprise One supports **SP** initiated SSO
+* Once you configure Planview Enterprise One you can enforce Session Control, which protect exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real-time. Session Control extend from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad)
+
+
+## Adding Planview Enterprise One from the gallery
+
+To configure the integration of Planview Enterprise One into Azure AD, you need to add Planview Enterprise One from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.
+
+1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
+1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
+1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
+1. To add new application, select **New application**.
+1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Planview Enterprise One** in the search box.
+1. Select **Planview Enterprise One** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.
+
+
+## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for Planview Enterprise One
+
+Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Planview Enterprise One using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Planview Enterprise One.
+
+To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Planview Enterprise One, complete the following building blocks:
+
+1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
+    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
+    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
+1. **[Configure Planview Enterprise One SSO](#configure-planview-enterprise-one-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
+    1. **[Create Planview Enterprise One test user](#create-planview-enterprise-one-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Planview Enterprise One that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
+1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.
+
+## Configure Azure AD SSO
+
+Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.
+

+   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)
+
+1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, enter the values for the following fields:
+
+	a. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
+    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.pvcloud.com/planview`
+
+    b. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
+    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.pvcloud.com/planview`
+
+	> [!NOTE]
+	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign on URL and Identifier. Contact [Planview Enterprise One Client support team](mailto:hostingsupport@planview.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.
+
+1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.
+
+	![The Certificate download link](common/metadataxml.png)
+
+1. On the **Set up Planview Enterprise One** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.
+
+	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

+# Azure Security Baseline for Azure Cache for Redis
+
+The Azure Security Baseline for Azure Cache for Redis contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment.
+
+The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/overview), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance.
+
+For more information, see [Azure Security Baselines overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview).
+
+## Network Security
+
+*For more information, see [Security Control: Network Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security).*
+
+### 1.1: Protect resources using Network Security Groups or Azure Firewall on your Virtual Network
+
+**Guidance**: Deploy your Azure Cache for Redis instance within a virtual network (VNet). A VNet is a private network in the cloud. When an Azure Cache for Redis instance is configured with a VNet, it is not publicly addressable and can only be accessed from virtual machines and applications within the VNet.
+
+You may also specify firewall rules with a start and end IP address range. When firewall rules are configured, only client connections from the specified IP address ranges can connect to the cache.
+
+How to configure Virtual Network Support for a Premium Azure Cache for Redis:
+
+https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-how-to-premium-vnet
+
+How to configure Azure Cache for Redis firewall rules:
+
+https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-configure#firewall
+
+**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available
+
+**Responsibility**: Customer
+
+### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of Vnets, Subnets, and NICs
+
+**Guidance**: When Virtual Machines are deployed in the same virtual network as your Azure Cache for Redis instance, you can use network security groups (NSG) to reduce the risk of data exfiltration. Enable NSG flow logs and send logs into an Azure Storage Account for traffic audit. You may also send NSG flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

+
+### 1.3: Protect critical web applications
+
+**Guidance**: Not applicable; this recommendation is intended for web applications running on Azure App Service or compute resources.
+
+**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable
+
+**Responsibility**: Customer
+
+### 1.4: Deny communications with known malicious IP addresses
+
+**Guidance**: Azure Virtual Network (VNet) deployment provides enhanced security and isolation for your Azure Cache for Redis, as well as subnets, access control policies, and other features to further restrict access. When deployed in a VNet, Azure Cache for Redis is not publicly addressable and can only be accessed from virtual machines and applications within the VNet.
+
+Enable DDoS Protection Standard on the VNets associated with your Azure Cache for Redis instances to guard against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Use Azure Security Center Integrated Threat Intelligence to deny communications with known malicious or unused Internet IP addresses.

+
+**Responsibility**: Customer
+
+### 1.5: Record network packets and flow logs
+
+**Guidance**: When virtual machines are deployed in the same virtual network as your Azure Cache for Redis instance, you can use network security groups (NSG) to reduce the risk of data exfiltration. Enable NSG flow logs and send logs into an Azure Storage Account for traffic audit. You may also send NSG flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

+
+**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes
+
+**Responsibility**: Customer
+
+### 1.6: Deploy network based intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS)
+
+**Guidance**: When using Azure Cache for Redis with your web applications running on Azure App Service or compute instances, deploy all resources within an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) and secure with an Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) on Web Application Gateway. Configure the WAF to run in ""Prevention Mode"". Prevention Mode blocks intrusions and attacks that the rules detect. The attacker receives a ""403 unauthorized access"" exception, and the connection is closed. Prevention mode records such attacks in the WAF logs.
+
+Alternatively, you may select an offer from the Azure Marketplace that supports IDS/IPS functionality with payload inspection and/or anomaly detection capabilities.
+
+Understand Azure WAF capabilities:

+### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules
+
+**Guidance**: Use virtual network service tags to define network access controls on network security groups (NSG) or Azure Firewall. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., ApiManagement) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.
+
+You may also use application security groups (ASG) to help simplify complex security configuration. ASGs enable you to configure network security as a natural extension of an application's structure, allowing you to group virtual machines and define network security policies based on those groups.

+## Data Recovery
+
+*For more information, see [Security Control: Data Recovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-control-data-recovery).*
+
+### 9.1: Ensure regular automated back ups
+
+**Guidance**: Enable Redis persistence. Redis persistence allows you to persist data stored in Redis. You can also take snapshots and back up the data, which you can load in case of a hardware failure. This is a huge advantage over Basic or Standard tier where all the data is stored in memory and there can be potential data loss in case of a failure where Cache nodes are down.
+
+You may also use Azure Cache for Redis Export. Export allows you to export the data stored in Azure Cache for Redis to Redis compatible RDB file(s). You can use this feature to move data from one Azure Cache for Redis instance to another or to another Redis server. During the export process, a temporary file is created on the virtual machine that hosts the Azure Cache for Redis server instance, and the file is uploaded to the designated storage account. When the export operation completes with either a status of success or failure, the temporary file is deleted.

 ## Usage
 
-### Calculate the average size of perf usage reports per computer
+The `Usage` data type can be used to track the ingested data volume by solution or data type. There are other techniques to study ingested data volumes by [computer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/manage-cost-storage#data-volume-by-computer) or [Azure subscription, resource group or resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/manage-cost-storage#data-volume-by-azure-resource-resource-group-or-subscription).
 
-This example calculates the average size of perf usage reports per computer, over the last 3 hours.
-The results are shown in a bar chart.
-```Kusto
+#### Data volume by solution
+
+The query used to view the billable data volume by solution over the last month (excluding the last partial day) is:
+
+```kusto
 Usage 
-| where TimeGenerated > ago(3h)
-| where DataType == ""Perf"" 
-| where QuantityUnit == ""MBytes"" 
-| summarize avg(Quantity) by Computer
-| sort by avg_Quantity desc nulls last
-| render barchart
+| where TimeGenerated > ago(32d)
+| where StartTime >= startofday(ago(31d)) and EndTime < startofday(now())
+| where IsBillable == true
+| summarize BillableDataGB = sum(Quantity) / 1000. by bin(StartTime, 1d), Solution | render barchart
 ```
 
-### Timechart latency percentiles 50 and 95
+Note that the clause `where IsBillable = true` filters out data types from certain solutions for which there is no ingestion charge.  Also the clause with `TimeGenerated` is only to ensure that the query experience in the Azure portal will look back beyond the default 24 hours. When using the Usage data type, `StartTime` and `EndTime` represent the time buckets for which results are presented. 
 
-This example calculates and charts the 50th and 95th percentiles of reported **avgLatency** by hour over the last 24 hours.
+#### Data volume by type
 
-```Kusto
-Usage
-| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
-| summarize percentiles(AvgLatencyInSeconds, 50, 95) by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h) 
-| render timechart

 ## Usage
 
-### Calculate the average size of perf usage reports per computer
+The `Usage` data type can be used to track the ingested data volume by solution or data type. There are other techniques to study ingested data volumes by [computer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/manage-cost-storage#data-volume-by-computer) or [Azure subscription, resource group or resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/manage-cost-storage#data-volume-by-azure-resource-resource-group-or-subscription).

+#### Data volume by solution
+
+The query used to view the billable data volume by solution over the last month (excluding the last partial day) is:
+
+```kusto
 Usage 
-| where TimeGenerated > ago(3h)
-| where DataType == ""Perf""

+| summarize BillableDataGB = sum(Quantity) / 1000. by bin(StartTime, 1d), Solution | render barchart
 ```
 
-### Timechart latency percentiles 50 and 95
+Note that the clause `where IsBillable = true` filters out data types from certain solutions for which there is no ingestion charge.  Also the clause with `TimeGenerated` is only to ensure that the query experience in the Azure portal will look back beyond the default 24 hours. When using the Usage data type, `StartTime` and `EndTime` represent the time buckets for which results are presented.

-# Automate Azure Application Insights processes with the connector for Microsoft Flow
-
-Do you find yourself repeatedly running the same queries on your telemetry data to check that your service is functioning properly? Are you looking to automate these queries for finding trends and anomalies and then build your own workflows around them? The Azure Application Insights connector for Microsoft Flow is the right tool for these purposes.
-
-With this integration, you can now automate numerous processes without writing a single line of code. After you create a flow by using an Application Insights action, the flow automatically runs your Application Insights Analytics query.
-
-You can add additional actions as well. Microsoft Flow makes hundreds of actions available. For example, you can use Microsoft Flow to automatically send an email notification or create a bug in Azure DevOps. You can also use one of the many [templates](https://ms.flow.microsoft.com/connectors/shared_applicationinsights/?slug=azure-application-insights) that are available for the connector for Microsoft Flow. These templates speed up the process of creating a flow.
-
-<!--The Application Insights connector also works with [Azure Power Apps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/) and [Azure Logic Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/logic-apps/?v=17.23h). -->
-
-## Create a flow for Application Insights
-
-In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a flow that uses the Analytics autocluster algorithm to group attributes in the data for a web application. The flow automatically sends the results by email, just one example of how you can use Microsoft Flow and Application Insights Analytics together.
-
-### Step 1: Create a flow
-
-1. Sign in to [Microsoft Flow](https://flow.microsoft.com), and then select **My Flows**.
-2. Click **New** then **Scheduled—from blank**.
-
-    ![Create new flow from scheduled blank](./media/automate-with-flow/1-create.png)
-
-### Step 2: Create a trigger for your flow
-
-1. In the popup **Build a scheduled flow**, fill out the name of your flow and how often you want your flow to run.
-
-    ![Set up schedule recurrence with entering frequency and interval](./media/automate-with-flow/2-schedule.png)
-
-1. Click **Create**.
-
-### Step 3: Add an Application Insights action
-
-1. Search for **Application Insights**.
-2. Click **Azure Application Insights - Visualize Analytics query**.
-
-    ![Choose an action: Azure Application Insights Visualize Analytics query](./media/automate-with-flow/3-visualize.png)
-
-3. Select **New step**.
-
-### Step 4: Connect to an Application Insights resource
-
-To complete this step, you need an application ID and an API key for your resource. You can retrieve them from the Azure portal, as shown in the following diagram:
-
-![Application ID in the Azure portal](./media/automate-with-flow/5apiaccess.png)
-
-![API Key in the Azure portal](./media/automate-with-flow/6apikey.png)
-
-Provide a name for your connection, along with the application ID and API key.
-
-   ![Microsoft Flow connection window](./media/automate-with-flow/4-connection.png)
-
-If the connection box does not show up right away and instead goes straight to entering the query, click the ellipses at the top right of the box. Then select my connections or use an existing one.
-
-Click **Create**.
-
-### Step 5: Specify the Analytics query and chart type
-This example query selects the failed requests within the last day and correlates them with exceptions that occurred as part of the operation. Analytics correlates them based on the operation_Id identifier. The query then segments the results by using the autocluster algorithm.
-
-When you create your own queries, verify that they are working properly in Analytics before you add it to your flow.
-
-- Add the following Analytics query, and select the HTML table chart type. Then select **New step**.
-
-    ```
-    requests
-    | where timestamp > ago(1d)
-    | where success == ""False""
-    | project name, operation_Id
-    | join ( exceptions
-        | project problemId, outerMessage, operation_Id
-    ) on operation_Id
-    | evaluate autocluster()
-    ```
-    
-    ![Analytics query configuration window](./media/automate-with-flow/5-query.png)
-
-### Step 6: Configure the flow to send email
-
-1. Search for **Office 365 Outlook**.
-2. Click **Office 365 Outlook - Send an email**.
-
-    ![Office 365 Outlook selection window](./media/automate-with-flow/6-outlook.png)
-
-1. In the **Send an email** window:
-
-   a. Type the email address of the recipient.
-
-   b. Type a subject for the email.
-
-   c. Click anywhere in the **Body** box and then, on the dynamic content menu that opens at the right, select **Body**.
-
-   e. Select **Show advanced options**
-
-1. On the dynamic content menu:
-
-    a. Select **Attachment Name**.
-
-    b. Select **Attachment Content**.
-    
-    c. In the **Is HTML** box, select **Yes**.
-
-    ![Office 365 Outlook configuration](./media/automate-with-flow/7-email.png)
-
-### Step 7: Save and test your flow
-
-Click **Save**.
-
-You can wait for the trigger to run this action, or can click on ![beaker test icon](./media/automate-with-flow/testicon.png) **Test** in the top.
-
-After selecting **Test**:
-
-1. Select **I'll perform the trigger action**.
-2. Select **Run Flow**.
-
-When the flow runs, the recipients you have specified in the email list receive an email message like the one below.

+# Azure Monitor Logs connector for Logic Apps and Flow
+[Azure Logic Apps](/azure/logic-apps/) and [Power Automate](https://ms.flow.microsoft.com) allow you to create automated workflows using hundreds of actions for a variety of services. The Azure Monitor Logs connector allows you to build workflows that retrieve data from a Log Analytics workspace or an Application Insights application in Azure Monitor. This article describes the actions included with the connector and provides a walkthrough to build a workflow using this data.
+
+For example, you can create a logic app to use Azure Monitor log data in an email notification from Office 365, create a bug in Azure DevOps, or post a Slack message.  You can trigger a workflow by a simple schedule or from some action in a connected service such as when a mail or a tweet is received. 
+
+## Actions
+The following table describes the actions included with the Azure Monitor Logs connector. Both allow you to run a log query against a Log Analytics workspace or Application Insights application. The difference is in the way the data is returned.
+
+> [!NOTE]
+> The Azure Monitor Logs connector replaces the [Azure Log Analytics connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/azureloganalytics/) and the [Azure Application Insights connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/applicationinsights/). This connector provides the same functionality as the others and is the preferred method for running a query against a Log Analytics workspace or an Application Insights application.
+
+
+| Action | Description |
+|:---|:---|
+| [Run query and and list results](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/azuremonitorlogs/#run-query-and-list-results) | Returns each row as its own object. Use this action when you want to work with each row separately in the rest of the workflow. The action is typically followed by a [For each activity](../../logic-apps/logic-apps-control-flow-loops.md#foreach-loop). |
+| [Run query and and visualize results](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/azuremonitorlogs/#run-query-and-visualize-results) | Returns all rows in the result set as a single formatted object. Use this action when you want to use the result set together in the rest of the workflow, such as sending the results in a mail.  |
+
+## Walkthroughs
+The following tutorials illustrate the use of the Azure Monitor connectors in Azure Logic Apps. You can perform these same example with Power Automate, the only difference being how to you create the initial workflow and run it when complete. Configuration of the workflow and actions is the same between both. See [Create a flow from a template in Power Automate](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-automate/get-started-logic-template) to get started.
+
+
+### Create a Logic App
+
+Go to **Logic Apps** in the Azure portal and click **Add**. Select a **Subscription**, **Resource group**, and **Region** to store the new logic app and then give it a unique name. You can turn on **Log Analytics** setting to collect information about runtime data and events as described in [Set up Azure Monitor logs and collect diagnostics data for Azure Logic Apps](../../logic-apps/monitor-logic-apps-log-analytics.md). This setting isn't required for using the Azure Monitor Logs connector.
+
+![Create logic app](media/logicapp-flow-connector/create-logic-app.png)
+
+
+Click **Review + create** and then **Create**. When the deployment is complete, click **Go to resource** to open the **Logic Apps Designer**.
+
+### Create a trigger for the logic app
+Under **Start with a common trigger**, select **Recurrence**. This creates a logic app that automatically runs at a regular interval. In the **Frequency** box of the action, select **Day** and in the **Interval** box, enter **1** to run the workflow once per day.
+
+![Recurrence action](media/logicapp-flow-connector/recurrence-action.png)
+
+## Walkthrough: Mail visualized results
+The following tutorial shows you how to create a logic app that sends the results of an Azure Monitor log query by email. 
+
+### Add Azure Monitor Logs action
+Click **+ New step** to add an action that runs after the recurrence action. Under **Choose an action**, type **azure monitor** and then select **Azure Monitor Logs**.

+![Run query and visualize results action](media/logicapp-flow-connector/select-query-action-visualize.png)
+
+
+### Add Azure Monitor Logs action
+
+Select the **Subscription** and **Resource Group** for your Log Analytics workspace. Select *Log Analytics Workspace* for the **Resource Type** and then select the workspace's name under **Resource Name**.
+
+Add the following log query to the **Query** window.  
+
+```Kusto
+Event
+| where EventLevelName == ""Error"" 
+| where TimeGenerated > ago(1day)
+| summarize TotalErrors=count() by Computer
+| sort by Computer asc   
+```
+
+Select *Set in query* for the **Time Range** and **HTML Table** for the **Chart Type**.
+   
+![Run query and visualize results action](media/logicapp-flow-connector/run-query-visualize-action.png)
+
+The mail will be sent by the account associated with the current connection. You can specify another account by clicking on **Change connection**.
+
+### Add email action
+
+Click **+ New step**, and then click **+ Add an action**. Under **Choose an action**, type **outlook** and then select **Office 365 Outlook**.

-## Azure Monitor for VMs (preview)
+## Azure Monitor for VMs
 This Microsoft FAQ is a list of commonly asked questions about Azure Monitor for VMs. If you have any additional questions about the solution, go to the [discussion forum](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/34192--general-feedback) and post your questions. When a question is frequently asked, we add it to this article so that it can be found quickly and easily.
 
 ### Can I onboard to an existing workspace?
 If your virtual machines are already connected to a Log Analytics workspace, you may continue to use that workspace when onboarding to Azure Monitor for VMs, provided it is in one of the supported regions listed [here](insights/vminsights-enable-overview.md#prerequisites).
 
-When onboarding, we configure performance counters for the workspace that will cause all of the VMs reporting data to the workspace to begin collecting this information for display and analysis in Azure Monitor for VMs.  As a result, you will see performance data from all of the VMs connected to the selected workspace.  The Health and Map features are only enabled for the VMs that you have specified to onboard.
-
-For more information on which performance counters are enabled, refer to our [enable overview](insights/vminsights-enable-overview.md#performance-counters-enabled) article.
 
 ### Can I onboard to a new workspace? 
 If your VMs are not currently connected to an existing Log Analytics workspace, you need to create a new workspace to store your data. Creating a new default workspace is done automatically if you configure a single Azure VM for Azure Monitor for VMs through the Azure portal.
 
-If you choose to use the script-based method, these steps are covered in the [Enable Azure Monitor for VMs (preview) using Azure PowerShell or Resource Manager template](insights/vminsights-enable-at-scale-powershell.md) article. 
+If you choose to use the script-based method, these steps are covered in the [Enable Azure Monitor for VMs using Azure PowerShell or Resource Manager template](insights/vminsights-enable-at-scale-powershell.md) article. 
 
 ### What do I do if my VM is already reporting to an existing workspace?
-If you are already collecting data from your virtual machines, you may have already configured it to report data to an existing Log Analytics workspace.  As long as that workspace is in one of our supported regions, you can enable Azure Monitor for VMs to that pre-existing workspace.  If the workspace you are already using is not in one of our supported regions, you won’t be able to onboard to Azure Monitor for VMs at this time.  We are actively working to support additional regions.

We are actively working to support additional regions.
 
->[!NOTE]
->We configure performance counters for the workspace that affects all VMs that report to the   workspace, whether or not you have chosen to onboard them to Azure Monitor for VMs. For more details on how performance counters are configured for the workspace, please refer to our [documentation](platform/data-sources-performance-counters.md). For information about the counters configured for Azure Monitor for VMs, please refer to our [enable Azure Monitor for VMs](insights/vminsights-enable-overview.md#performance-counters-enabled) article.  
 
 ### Why did my VM fail to onboard?
 When onboarding an Azure VM from the Azure portal, the following steps occur:
 
 * A default Log Analytics workspace is created, if that option was selected.
-* The performance counters are configured for selected workspace. If this step fails, you notice that some of the performance charts and tables aren't showing data for the VM you onboarded. You can fix this by running the PowerShell script documented [here](insights/vminsights-enable-at-scale-powershell.md#enable-performance-counters).
 * The Log Analytics agent is installed on Azure VMs using a VM extension, if determined it is required.  
-* The Azure Monitor for VMs Map Dependency agent is installed on Azure VMs using an extension, if determined it is required.  
-* Azure Monitor components supporting the Health feature are configured, if needed, and the VM is configured to report health data.
+* The Azure Monitor for VMs Map Dependency agent is installed on Azure VMs using an extension, if determined it is required. 
 
-During the onboard process, we check for status on each of the above to return a notification status to you in the portal. Configuration of the workspace and the agent installation typically takes 5 to 10 minutes. Viewing monitoring and health data in the portal take an additional 5 to 10 minutes.

 If you have initiated onboarding and see messages indicating the VM needs to be onboarded,  allow for up to 30 minutes for the VM to complete the process. 
 
-### I only enabled Azure Monitor for VMs, Why do I see all my VMs monitored by the Health feature?
-The Health feature is enabled for all VMs that are connected to the Log Analytics workspace, even when the action is initiated for a single VM.
-
-### Can I modify the schedule for when health criteria evaluates a condition?
-No, the time period and frequency of health criteria can't be modified with this release. 
-
-### Can I disable health criteria for a condition I don't need to monitor?
-Health criteria can't be disabled in this release.
-
-### Are the health alert severities configurable?  
-Health alert severity cannot be modified, they can only be enabled or disabled. Additionally, some alert severities update based on the state of health criteria. 
-
-### If I reconfigure the settings of a particular health criteria, can it be scoped to a specific instance?  
-If you modify any setting of a health criterion instance, all health criteria instances of the same type on the Azure VM are modified. For example, if the threshold of the disk free-space health criterion instance that corresponds to logical disk C: is modified, this threshold applies to all other logical disks that are discovered and monitored for the same VM.

-### Does the Health feature monitor logical processors and cores?
-No, individual processor and logical processor level health criteria is not included for a Windows, only Total CPU utilization is monitored by default to effectively evaluate CPU pressure based on the total number of logical CPUs available to the Azure VM. 
-
-### Are all health criteria thresholds configurable?  
-Thresholds for health criteria that target a Windows VM aren’t modifiable, because their health states are set to *running* or *available*. When you query the health state from the [Workload Monitor API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/monitor/microsoft.workloadmonitor/components), it displays the *comparisonOperator* value of **LessThan** or **GreaterThan** with a *threshold* value of **4** for the service or entity if:
-   - DNS Client Service Health – Service isn't running. 
-   - DHCP client service health – Service isn't running. 
-   - RPC Service Health – Service isn't running. 
-   - Windows firewall service health – Service isn't running.
-   - Windows event log service health – Service isn't running. 
-   - Server service health – Service isn't running. 
-   - Windows remote management service health – Service isn't running. 
-   - File system error or corruption – Logical Disk is unavailable.
-
-Thresholds for the following Linux health criteria aren’t modifiable, because their health state is already set to *true*. The health state displays the *comparisonOperator* with a value **LessThan** and *threshold* value of **1** when queried from the Workload Monitoring API for the entity, depending on its context:
-   - Logical Disk Status – Logical disk isn't online/ available
-   - Disk Status – Disk isn't online/ available
-   - Network Adapter Status -  Network adapter is disabled
-
-### How do I modify alerts that are included with the Health feature?
-Alert rules that are defined for each health criterion aren't displayed in the Azure portal. You can enable or disable a health alert rule only in the [Workload Monitor API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/monitor/microsoft.workloadmonitor/components). Also, you can't assign an [Azure Monitor action group](platform/action-groups.md) for health alerts in the Azure portal. You can only use the notification setting API to configure an action group to be triggered whenever a health alert is fired. Currently, you can assign action groups against a VM so that all *health alerts* fired against the VM trigger the same action groups. Unlike traditional Azure alerts, there's no concept of a separate action group for each health alert rule. Additionally, only action groups that are configured to provide email or SMS notifications are supported when health alerts are triggered.

+This article explains how to enable Azure Monitor for VMs for Azure virtual machines or virtual machine scale sets by using Azure Policy. At the end of this process, you will have successfully configured enabling the Log Analytics and Dependency agents and identified virtual machines that aren't compliant.
 
 To discover, manage, and enable Azure Monitor for VMs for all of your Azure virtual machines or virtual machine scale sets, you can use either Azure Policy or Azure PowerShell. Azure Policy is the method we recommend because you can manage policy definitions to effectively govern your subscriptions to ensure consistent compliance and automatic enabling of newly provisioned VMs. These policy definitions:
 
 * Deploy the Log Analytics agent and the Dependency agent.
 * Report on compliance results.
 * Remediate for noncompliant VMs.
 
-If you're interested in accomplishing these tasks with Azure PowerShell or an Azure Resource Manager template, see [Enable Azure Monitor for VMs (preview) using Azure PowerShell or Azure Resource Manager templates](vminsights-enable-at-scale-powershell.md).

For example, [dcount()](/azure/kusto/query/dcount-aggfunction) uses the HyperLogLog algorithm to provide close estimation to distinct count of large sets of data without actually counting each value; the percentile functions are doing similar approximations using the nearest rank percentile algorithm. Several of the commands include optional parameters to reduce their impact.

 ## Data used for processed query
 
 A critical factor in the processing of the query is the volume of data that is scanned and used for the query processing. Azure Data Explorer uses aggressive optimizations that dramatically reduce the data volume compared to other data platforms. Still, there are critical factors in the query that can impact the data volume that is used.

 In Azure Monitor Logs, the **TimeGenerated** column is used as a way to index the data. Restricting the **TimeGenerated** values to as narrow a range as possible will make a significant improvement to query performance by significantly limiting the amount of data that has to be processed.
 
-Another factor that increases the data that is process is the use of large number of tables. This usually happens when `search *` and `union *` commands are used. These commands force the system to evaluate and scan data from all tables in the workspace. In some cases, there might be hundreds of tables in the workspace. Try to avoid as much as possible using “search *” or any search without scoping it to a specific table.

 Resource owners may believe that the **All users** group contains only **Enterprise Employees** when they may actually contain both **Enterprise Employees** and **Guests**. As a result, you should take special care when using the **All users** group for application assignment and granting access to resources such as SharePoint content or applications.

+
+# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with InVision
+
+In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate InVision with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate InVision with Azure AD, you can:
+
+* Control in Azure AD who has access to InVision.
+* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to InVision with their Azure AD accounts.
+* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.
+
+To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on).
+
+## Prerequisites
+
+To get started, you need the following items:
+
+* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
+* InVision single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
+
+## Scenario description
+
+In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.
+
+* InVision supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO
+* Once you configure InVision you can enforce session control, which protect exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real-time. Session control extend from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
+
+## Adding InVision from the gallery
+
+To configure the integration of InVision into Azure AD, you need to add InVision from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.
+
+1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
+1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
+1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
+1. To add new application, select **New application**.
+1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **InVision** in the search box.
+1. Select **InVision** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.
+
+## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for InVision
+
+Configure and test Azure AD SSO with InVision using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in InVision.
+
+To configure and test Azure AD SSO with InVision, complete the following building blocks:
+
+1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
+    * **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
+    * **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
+1. **[Configure InVision SSO](#configure-invision-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
+    * **[Create InVision test user](#create-invision-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in InVision that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
+1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.
+
+## Configure Azure AD SSO
+
+Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.
+
+1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **InVision** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
+1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
+1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.
+
+   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)
+
+1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, enter the values for the following fields:
+
+    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:

 ## Self-service group management scenarios
 
 * **Delegated group management**
-    An example is an administrator who is managing access to a SaaS application that the company is using. Managing these access rights is becoming cumbersome, so this administrator asks the business owner to create a new group. The administrator assigns access for the application to the new group, and adds to the group all people already accessing the application. The business owner then can add more users, and those users are automatically provisioned to the application. The business owner doesn't need to wait for the administrator to manage access for users. If the administrator grants the same permission to a manager in a different business group, then that person can also manage access for their own group members. Neither the business owner nor the manager can view or manage each other’s group memberships. The administrator can still see all users who have access to the application and block access rights if needed.

 * **Self-service group management**
-    An example of this scenario is two users who both have SharePoint Online sites that they set up independently. They want to give each other’s teams access to their sites. To accomplish this, they can create one group in Azure AD, and in SharePoint Online each of them selects that group to provide access to their sites. When someone wants access, they request it from the Access Panel, and after approval they get access to both SharePoint Online sites automatically. Later, one of them decides that all people accessing the site should also get access to a particular SaaS application. The administrator of the SaaS application can add access rights for the  application to the SharePoint Online site. From then on, any requests that get approved gives access to the two SharePoint Online sites and also to this SaaS application.

+
+#Customer intent: As a developer using Azure App Configuration, I want to understand how to use private endpoints to enable secure communication with my App Configuration instance.
+---
+# Using private endpoints for Azure App Configuration
+
+You can use [private endpoints](../private-link/private-endpoint-overview.md) for Azure App Configuration to allow clients on a virtual network (VNet) to securely access data over a [private link](../private-link/private-link-overview.md). The private endpoint uses an IP address from the VNet address space for your App Configuration store. Network traffic between the clients on the VNet and the App Configuration store traverses over the VNet using a private link on the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure to the public internet.
+
+Using private endpoints for your App Configuration store enables you to:
+- Secure your application configuration details by configuring the firewall to block all connections to App Configuration on the public endpoint.
+- Increase security for the virtual network (VNet) ensuring data doesn't escape from the VNet.
+- Securely connect to the App Configuration store from on-premises networks that connect to the VNet using [VPN](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways.md) or [ExpressRoutes](../expressroute/expressroute-locations.md) with private-peering.
+
+> [!NOTE]
+> Azure App Configuration offers the use of private endpoints as a public preview. Public preview offerings allow customers to experiment with new features prior to their official release.  Public preview features and services are not meant for production use.
+
+## Conceptual Overview
+
+A private endpoint is a special network interface for an Azure service in your [Virtual Network](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md) (VNet). When you create a private endpoint for your App Config store, it provides secure connectivity between clients on your VNet and your configuration store. The private endpoint is assigned an IP address from the IP address range of your VNet. The connection between the private endpoint and the configuration store uses a secure private link.
+
+Applications in the VNet can connect to the configuration store over the private endpoint **using the same connection strings and authorization mechanisms that they would use otherwise**. Private endpoints can be used with all protocols supported by the App Configuration store.
+
+While App Configuration doesn't support service endpoints, private endpoints can be created in subnets that use [Service Endpoints](../virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview.md). Clients in a subnet can connect securely to an App Configuration store using the private endpoint while using service endpoints to access others.  
+
+When you create a private endpoint for a service in your VNet, a consent request is sent for approval to the service account owner. If the user requesting the creation of the private endpoint is also an owner of the account, this consent request is automatically approved.
+
+Service account owners can manage consent requests and private endpoints through the `Private Endpoints` tab of the config store in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
+
+### Private Endpoints for App Configuration 
+
+When creating a private endpoint, you must specify the App Configuration store to which it connects. If you have multiple App Configuration instances within an account, you need a separate private endpoint for each store.
+
+#### Resources for creating private endpoints
+
+For more detailed information on creating a private endpoint for your App Configuration store, refer to the following articles:
+
+- [Create a private endpoint using the Private Link Center in the Azure portal](../private-link/create-private-endpoint-portal.md)
+- [Create a private endpoint using Azure CLI](../private-link/create-private-endpoint-cli.md)
+- [Create a private endpoint using Azure PowerShell](../private-link/create-private-endpoint-powershell.md)
+
+### Connecting to Private Endpoints
+
+Azure relies upon DNS resolution to route connections from the VNet to the configuration store over a private link. You can quickly find connections strings in the Azure portal by selecting your App Configuration store, then selecting **Settings** > **Access Keys**.

+> Use the same connection string to connect to your App Configuration store using private endpoints as you would use for a public endpoint. Don't connect to the storage account using its `privatelink` subdomain URL.
+
+## DNS changes for Private Endpoints
+
+When you create a private endpoint, the DNS CNAME resource record for the configuration store is updated to an alias in a subdomain with the prefix `privatelink`. Azure also creates a [private DNS zone](../dns/private-dns-overview.md) corresponding to the `privatelink` subdomain, with the DNS A resource records for the private endpoints.
+
+When you resolve the endpoint URL from outside the VNet, it resolves to the public endpoint of the store. When resolved from within the VNet hosting the private endpoint, the endpoint URL resolves to the private endpoint.
+
+You can control access for clients outside the VNet through the public endpoint using the Azure Firewall service.
+
+This approach enables access to the store **using the same connection string** for clients on the VNet hosting the private endpoints as well as clients outside the VNet.
+
+If you are using a custom DNS server on your network, clients must be able to resolve the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the service endpoint to the private endpoint IP address. Configure your DNS server to delegate your private link subdomain to the private DNS zone for the VNet, or configure the A records for `AppConfigInstanceA.privatelink.azconfig.io` with the private endpoint IP address.
+
+> [!TIP]
+> When using a custom or on-premises DNS server, you should configure your DNS server to resolve the store name in the `privatelink` subdomain to the private endpoint IP address. You can do this by delegating the `privatelink` subdomain to the private DNS zone of the VNet, or configuring the DNS zone on your DNS server and adding the DNS A records.
+
+#### Resources for configuring your DNS server with private endpoints

+
+## Pricing
+
+Enabling private endpoints requires a [Standard tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-configuration/) App Configuration store.  To learn about private link pricing details, see [Azure Private Link pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/private-link).

 # What is Distributed Tracing?
 
-The advent of modern cloud and [microservices](https://azure.com/microservices) architectures has given rise to simple, independently deployable services that can help reduce costs while increasing availability and throughput. But while these movements have made individual services easier to understand as a whole, they’ve made overall systems more difficult to reason about and debug.

+# Source map support for JavaScript applications
+
+Application Insights supports the uploading of source maps to your own Storage Account Blob Container.
+Source maps can be used to unminify call stacks found on the end to end transaction details page. Any exception sent by the [JavaScript SDK][ApplicationInsights-JS] or the [Node.js SDK][ApplicationInsights-Node.js] can be unminified with source maps.
+
+![Unminify a Call Stack by linking with a Storage Account](./media/source-map-support/details-unminify.gif)
+
+## Create a new storage account and Blob container
+
+If you already have an existing storage account or blob container, you can skip this step.
+
+1. [Create a new storage account][create storage account]
+2. [Create a blob container][create blob container] inside your storage account. Be sure to set the ""Public access level"" to `Private`, to ensure that your source maps are not publicly accessible.
+
+> [!div class=""mx-imgBorder""]
+>![Your container access level must be set to Private](./media/source-map-support/container-access-level.png)
+
+## Push your source maps to your Blob container
+
+You should integrate your continuous deployment pipeline with your storage account by configuring it to automatically upload your source maps to the configured Blob container. You should not upload your source maps to a subfolder in the Blob container; currently the source map will only be fetched from the root folder.
+
+### Upload source maps via Azure Pipelines (recommended)
+
+If you are using Azure Pipelines to continuously build and deploy your application, add an [Azure File Copy][azure file copy] task to your pipeline to automatically upload your source maps.
+
+> [!div class=""mx-imgBorder""]
+> ![Add an Azure File Copy task to your Pipeline to upload your source maps to Azure Blob Storage](./media/source-map-support/azure-file-copy.png)
+
+## Configure your Application Insights resource with a Source Map storage account
+
+### From the end-to-end transaction details page
+
+From the end-to-end transaction details tab, you can click on *Unminify* and it will display a prompt to configure if your resource is unconfigured.
+
+1. In the Portal, view the details of an exception that is minified.
+2. Click on *Unminify*
+3. If your resource has not been configured, a message will appear, prompting you to configure.
+
+### From the properties page
+
+If you would like to configure or change the storage account or Blob container that is linked to your Application Insights Resource, you can do it by viewing the Application Insights resource's *Properties* tab.
+
+1. Navigate to the *Properties* tab of your Application Insights resource.
+2. Click on *Change source map blob container*.
+3. Select a different Blob container as your source maps container.
+4. Click `Apply`.

+> ![Reconfigure your selected Azure Blob Container by navigating to the Properties Blade](./media/source-map-support/reconfigure.png)
+
+## Troubleshooting
+
+### Required role-based access control (RBAC) settings on your Blob container
+
+Any user on the Portal using this feature must be at least assigned as a [Storage Blob Data Reader][storage blob data reader] to your Blob container. You must assign this role to anyone else that will be using the source maps through this feature.
+
+> [!NOTE]
+> Depending on how the container was created, this may not have been automatically assigned to you or your team.
+
+### Source map not found
+
+1. Verify that the corresponding source map is uploaded to the correct blob container
+2. Verify that the source map file is named after the JavaScript file it maps to, suffixed with `.map`.
+    - For example, `/static/js/main.4e2ca5fa.chunk.js` will search for the blob named `main.4e2ca5fa.chunk.js.map`
+3. Check your browser's console to see if any errors are being logged. Include this in any support ticket.

 * **Throttling**: Throttling limits the data rate to 32,000 events per second, averaged over 1 minute per instrumentation key. The volume of data that your app sends is assessed every minute. If it exceeds the per-second rate averaged over the minute, the server refuses some requests. The SDK buffers the data and then tries to resend it. It spreads out a surge over several minutes. If your app consistently sends data at more than the throttling rate, some data will be dropped. (The ASP.NET, Java, and JavaScript SDKs try to resend data this way; other SDKs might simply drop throttled data.) If throttling occurs, a notification warning alerts you that this has occurred.

 ## Data transfer charges using Application Insights
 
-Sending data to Application Insights might incur data bandwidth charges. As described in the [Azure Bandwidth pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/bandwidth/), data transfer between Azure services located in two regions charged as outbound data transfer at the normal rate. Inbound data transfer is free. However, this charge is very small (few %) compared to the costs for Application Insights log data ingestion. Consequently controlling costs for Log Analytics needs to focus on your ingested data volume, and we have guidance to help understand that [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/pricing#managing-your-data-volume).

 * A data volume allocation of 200 MB per day is given for each node that's detected (with hourly granularity). Unused data allocation isn't carried over from one day to the next.
   * If you choose the Per Node pricing tier, each subscription gets a daily allowance of data based on the number of nodes that send telemetry to the Application Insights resources in that subscription. So, if you have five nodes that send data all day, you'll have a pooled allowance of 1 GB applied to all Application Insights resources in that subscription. It doesn't matter if certain nodes send more data than other nodes because the included data is shared across all nodes. If on a given day, the Application Insights resources receive more data than is included in the daily data allocation for this subscription, the per-GB overage data charges apply.

So, if you have four nodes that send telemetry during 15 of the 24 hours in the day, the included data for that day would be ((4 &#215; 15) / 24) &#215; 200 MB = 500 MB.

 | 1 application using 3 Azure App Service instances and 1 virtual server | 4 |

 * The precise node counting depends on which Application Insights SDK your application is using. 
-  * In SDK versions 2.2 and later, both the Application Insights [Core SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights/) and the [Web SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Web/) report each application host as a node. Examples are the computer name for physical server and VM hosts or the instance name for cloud services.  The only exception is an application that uses only the [.NET Core](https://dotnet.github.io/) and the Application Insights Core SDK. In that case, only one node is reported for all hosts because the host name isn't available.

+# Azure Relay metrics in Azure Monitor 
 Azure Relay metrics give you the state of resources in your Azure subscription. With a rich set of metrics data, you can assess the overall health of your Relay resources, not only at the namespace level, but also at the entity level. These statistics can be important as they help you to monitor the state of Azure Relay. Metrics can also help troubleshoot root-cause issues without needing to contact Azure support.
 
 Azure Monitor provides unified user interfaces for monitoring across various Azure services. For more information, see [Monitoring in Microsoft Azure](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview.md) and the [Retrieve Azure Monitor metrics with .NET](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/monitor-dotnet-metrics-api) sample on GitHub.

 4. The exporter will send metric data to Azure Monitor at a fixed interval. The default is every 15 seconds. We're tracking a single metric, so this metric data, with whatever value and time stamp it contains, will be sent every interval. You can find the data under `customMetrics`.
 
+#### Standard metrics
+
+By default, the metrics exporter will send a set of standard metrics to Azure Monitor. You can disable this by setting the `enable_standard_metrics` flag to `False` in the constructor of the metrics exporter.
+
+    ```python
+    ...
+    exporter = metrics_exporter.new_metrics_exporter(
+      enable_standard_metrics=False,
+      connection_string='InstrumentationKey=<your-instrumentation-key-here>')
+    ...
+    ```
+Below is a list of standard metrics that are currently sent:
+
+- Available Memory (bytes)
+- CPU Processor Time (percentage)
+- Incoming Request Rate (per second)
+- Incoming Request Average Execution Time (milliseconds)
+- Outgoing Request Rate (per second)
+- Process CPU Usage (percentage)
+- Process Private Bytes (bytes)
+
+You should be able to see these metrics in `performanceCounters`. Incoming request rate would be under `customMetrics`.
